I was feelin’ kinda weary,
Quoth the mirror, “Boy, you scary—
But damn, you could be fine.”
I’ve written odes to death and sorrow,
Dreamt no joy for each tomorrow,
Then I thought, “Why beg or borrow,
When I could sip this wine?”

Nevermore, I’ll cry in vain,
Nevermore, I’ll wear my pain—
Got lace and lust, not guilt or shame,
Call me Edgar Allan Hoe.
From crypt to club, I make it known,
My heart’s as black as onyx stone,
But tonight, I sin alone—
Yeah, I’m Edgar Allan Hoe.


Lenore said love was fleeting,
But my thirst needs constant feeding,
Now I’m ghostin’, never pleading,
Just vibin’ with the moon.
My quill drips ink and temptation,
Dark rhymes, divine flirtation,
A freak in poetic formation

Desire is my doom.


Hear the ravens on the wire,
Whisper tales of want and fire,
“Poe,” they croak, “you’ve gone entire—
From goth to gigolo.”
I just smirk beneath my cloak,
Light my candle, let it smoke,
In decadence I’m newly woke—
A cursed romantic pro.


Nevermore, I’ll grieve the dead,
I’ll kiss the living lips instead,
My soul’s still dark, but my bed’s well-fed,
Call me Edgar Allan Hoe.
Roses wilt and hearts decay,
But I’m still serving night and day,
In lace and sin, I’ll fade away—
Forever Edgar Allan Hoe.

A Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts. However, during analysis it was noted there was a lack of paint on the bird's beaks and claws suggesting that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with motorbikes, while only 2% were killed by cars.

The RCMP then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of motorbike kills versus car kills. The Ornithological Behaviourist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger.

They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""Cah"", not a single one could shout ""bike""",True

Their high metabolism and constant feeding keep food moving through a short digestive tract, where nutrients are absorbed rapidly. A large cecum—a specialized pouch containing diverse microbes—helps break down plant material but also generates a high volume of fibrous waste. Combined, these traits allow mice to process and eliminate food within hours. So if you ever suspect you’ve got a few visitors, you’ll know soon enough—just follow the brown brick road😉

Full recipe and helpful tips: [https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/sweet-potato-rolls](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/sweet-potato-rolls)

# Ingredients

1 large sweet potato (about 8 oz.), scrubbed

½ cup (packed; 100 g) light brown sugar

¼ cup whole milk

1 ¼-oz. envelope instant yeast (about 2¼ tsp.)

3 large eggs, divided

½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted, plus more for pan and serving

1 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 2¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more

3 cups (375 g) bread flour

Vegetable oil (for bowl)

Flaky sea salt (optional)

# Preparation

* Step 1: Cut 2–3 shallow slits along length of **1 large sweet potato (about 8 oz.), scrubbed**. Place in a medium microwave-safe bowl; add ½ cup water. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and microwave until sweet potato is tender, about 15 minutes; drain. (Or, steam sweet potato in a steamer basket set over a pot of simmering water until tender, 20–22 minutes.) Let sit until cool enough to handle. Peel; smash flesh to a coarse purée.
* Step 2: Transfer 1 cup (packed; 235 g) purée to the bowl of a stand mixer. Add **½ cup (packed; 100 g) light brown sugar**, **¼ cup whole milk**, **one ¼-oz. envelope instant yeast (about 2¼ tsp.)**, **2 large eggs**, **½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted**, and **1 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 2¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt**; mix with a fork to combine. Add **3 cups (375 g) bread flour**, fit mixer with dough hook, and beat on medium-low speed until a soft, smooth dough forms (it may stick to bottom of bowl but should mostly come away from sides), 12–15 minutes.
* Step 3: Turn dough out onto a surface (unfloured) and shape into a ball. Lightly coat mixer bowl with **vegetable oil**. Return dough to bowl, cover tightly with a plate or plastic wrap, and let sit in a warm, draft-free spot until nearly doubled in size, about 2 hours. (For optimal flavor, let dough rise at room temperature 30 minutes, then chill 12 hours to proof slowly.)
* Step 4: Transfer dough to a clean surface (no need to bring to room temperature if chilled; cold dough is easier to work with). Using a bench scraper or paring knife, cut dough into 20 portions (about 43 g each). Working one at a time, cup your hand over dough and drag across surface, moving your hand in a rapid circular motion, to form dough into a tight ball (rolling into balls on an unfloured, ungreased surface creates friction and helps the shaping process). Brush a 13x9"" baking pan with butter and arrange rolls in pan. Cover with plastic wrap; let sit in a warm, draft-free spot until nearly doubled in size and puffy, about 2 hours. Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°. Whisk remaining **1 large egg** and a large pinch of kosher salt in a small bowl to blend. Gently brush tops of rolls with egg. Bake until deep golden brown on top and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a roll registers 190°, 30–35 minutes.
* Step 5: Generously brush hot rolls with melted butter; sprinkle lightly with **flaky sea salt** if desired. Let cool at least 15 minutes before serving.
*  **Do Ahead:** Sweet potato can be puréed 3 days ahead; transfer to an airtight container. Cover and chill. Rolls (without butter and sea salt) can be baked 1 day ahead; store airtight at room temperature. Reheat, loosely covered in foil, in a 325° oven until warmed through, about 10 minutes. Alternatively, freeze rolls up to 1 month ahead. Let cool; wrap pan tightly in plastic, then foil. Thaw, wrapped, in fridge 12 hours. Remove foil and plastic wrap, re-cover loosely with foil, and reheat in a 325° oven until warmed through, about 15 minutes. Generously brush rolls with butter and sprinkle lightly with sea salt if desired.",False

-In a bowl, mix three eggs, 250 grams of ricotta, a pinch of salt, pepper, and grated Parmesan cheese.

-In a pan, cook the spinach with a sauté of garlic, oil, and parsley. The spinach should release almost all its water, so at the end of cooking, increase the heat and stir frequently so it becomes more flavorful. Add salt halfway through cooking.

-In an 18 cm baking pan, roll out the puff pastry and, after cutting the eggplant into 0.5 cm thick strips, arrange them along the edges and bottom. In addition to helping the spinach hold its shape, they will add a firm, sweet flavor to every bite.

-Once the spinach is cooked, mix it with the eggs and ricotta prepared earlier.

-Gently pour the mixture into the puff pastry and cover with more puff pastry.

-Decorate the top as desired.  I use leftover puff pastry, brushing it with extra virgin olive oil for added crunchiness, and I added sunflower seeds to the center and breadcrumbs to the outside.

-Bake at 180 degrees Celsius for 40 minutes. In a convection oven, reduce the temperature to 170 degrees Celsius.

-Once baked, it needs to cool completely to fully appreciate all the flavors and achieve the right consistency, so prepare it ahead of time.

It will easily last three days in the refrigerator.

This year I switched it up a bit and went with Paprika Hendl with galushka based on the recipe from [Tasting History.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMNFERb-7Hw&t=407s)

Overall, I'd give it a...6/10.  The chicken and sauce came out pretty good.  Meat was very tender and flavorful and while I'm not a big fan of dark meat, the chicken thighs worked great.  Sauce seemed a little runny.  But I chock that up to me maybe tempering the sour cream as well as I should have or letting it reduce long enough.  The galushka, on the other hand?  Eh. It was kind of bland, a pain to make, and didn't bring much to the table, so to speak. I get it's basically there to be a simple carb that soaks up sauce and included it for the sake of authenticity. But wasn't really wowed by it.  
  
The real win came the next day though.  Had like, eight leftover chicken thighs and a ton of leftover sauce.  So I cooked about two cups of minute rice in the sauce, cut up the chicken, added some frozen veggies, and made a very servicable and tasty casserole that should last me a few days at least.  Paired it with a little cranberry sauce and it was quite good.  
  
Were I to do this recipe again, think some cayenne and garlic wouldn't go amiss. Might also use smoked paprika to deepen the flavor.  The longish braise and simmer certainly does the meat some good and while the prep is a little labor intensive, would recommend for your Halloween feasts or if you're looking to make something simple that can be stretched.",False

​Amazing Malai Chana Masala recipe! 


​Step 1: Boil Chana & Gravy Base
​Soak the chana dal (split chickpeas). Pressure cook the chana with salt and water (2 whistles).
​Separately, in a tiffin box, boil the gravy ingredients alongside the chana (2-3 whistles): onion, garlic, tomato, soaked cashews, and peanuts. Add a little salt, oil, and water.


​Step 2: Prepare Paste
​Cool the boiled onion and tomato mixture, then blend it into a smooth paste.
​Step 3: Fry the Paste
​Heat oil in a pan. Add 1 tsp cumin (jeera) and a bay leaf. Once they splutter, add the paste and fry until the oil begins to separate.


​Step 4: Add Spices and Curd
​In a bowl, mix 2-3 tbsp curd (dahi) with turmeric powder, red chili powder, chana masala, and kasuri methi.
​Add this spice-curd mixture to the frying paste and cook for another 2-3 minutes.


​Step 5: Finish the Curry
​Add the boiled chana to the masala.
​Add water for your desired gravy consistency and simmer briefly.


​Serve hot with Naan, Kulcha, or Poori! Thank you for sharing the recipe! 😋",False

Basically what I’m trying to do is create a version of smoked pork ribs Italian-style…mainly because I get sick of the typical barbecue flavors.

I created a rub with ground rosemary, fennel seeds, thyme, garlic powder, onion powder, salt and black pepper. I put that on the ribs after brushing with a honey-mustard binder and let them sit in the fridge overnight.

Then I smoked using my standard process for ribs:

1. Bring the smoker to 235F
2. Place the ribs on the rack meat-side up and smoke for 2 1/2 hours (I spritzed every 30 minutes with a dry white wine and champagne vinegar solution)
3. Wrap the ribs in foil meat-side down with honey, butter, onion powder, sugar and some of the spritz solution…return the the smoker for 1 1/2 hours
4. Unwrap and place back in the smoker meat-side up for 30 minutes, brushing with a homemade Italian flavored ""BBQ sauce"" (confit tomatoes, balsamic vinegar and red pepper flakes)
5. Remove from the smoker and let rest for 30 minutes before serving (wrap in paper and place in a room-temp cooler if you can).

1oiyllg,[I Ate] korean Bibimbap,1761724876.0,47,0,False,"Bibimbap (비빔밥) is one of the most famous and beloved Korean dishes — the name literally means “mixed rice.”

It’s a bowl of warm white rice topped with a colorful assortment of vegetables (namul), a bit of protein (often beef, but sometimes chicken, tofu, or even a fried egg), and a generous dollop of gochujang (Korean red chili paste).

Here’s what usually goes into it:

Julienned vegetables like carrots, zucchini, spinach, bean sprouts, and mushrooms

Fried egg (sunny-side up is classic)

Sliced beef (bulgogi style) or other protein

Steamed white rice as the base

Gochujang for heat, sweetness, and depth of flavor

Sometimes soy sauce and sesame oil for extra aroma.

You eat it by mixing everything together right before eating, coating all ingredients with the gochujang and sesame oil — creating a harmony of textures and flavors: spicy, savory, nutty, and slightly sweet.

There’s also a variation called dolsot bibimbap (돌솥비빔밥), served in a hot stone bowl that keeps the rice sizzling and creates a delicious crispy crust at the bottom.

1oi5qhj,"[I Ate]  Black fungus Mushrooms and pak choi: a simple pairing, a revelation.",1761647389.0,3,0,False,"You take those big, beautiful strips of pak choi, braise them until they sigh with tenderness, then slam them into a wok with some rehydrated, earthy black fungus. A little splash of Shaoxing wine for depth, a shower of toasted sesame seeds for crunch and perfume, and you've got something that, frankly, can't be messed up. It's a culinary safety net. It works with steamed rice, fried rice, noodles—the whole damn lot.  
I was mildly floored to find this relic on the menu at Hatari restaurant Gariahaat.  
Had to order it, obviously. And when that first heaped spoonful of the stuff perched atop fragrant, Indo-Chinese mixed fried rice hit me, I was stupefied for a solid few seconds. It wasn't just food; it was a goddamn time machine.  
This taste... it projectile-launched me straight back into the late nineties, the turn of the millennium. My friends and I, independently at first, started making the pilgrimage to the eateries in Tangra(The New Chinatown). Our spiritual home? Kim Fa. Not just because it was cheap, but because that kitchen was manned by an army of Chinese grandmothers and a handful of elderly Chinese uncles. When you see a crew like that calling the shots, you know you're not getting fusion fluff. You're getting the gospel, the sheer, unapologetic might of Indo-Hakka culinary tradition. It was an education. It blew the doors open to a whole world of classics: the rice porridge bloated with an unholy amount of pork, pak choi or morning glory fried simply with garlic, braised pork and eggs swimming in soy, pork ball clear broth, green chilli chicken, whole steamed bhetki, and, of course, this beauty—the black fungus stir-fried with pak choi. It was like running into a long-lost friend. The taste was there: those faintly bitter, earthy notes, the clean snap and crunch of the pak choi effortlessly playing off the jiggly, slippery texture of the fungus. It's an honest dish. I'm glad to be reunited with a taste of my childhood and my pre-teens. Life was good then, and it's good now, especially knowing where to find this old friend. Kolkata, you sneaky bastard. You never ever disappoint.",False

This piece was cut in half so the big size of it was pretty hard to work with unfortunately resulting in a bit of tearing near the skin. The whole meal was tree nut and gluten free. 

If anyone else wants to try cooking salmon for the first time, start by covering the bottom of your pan with oil. Start with a low tempreture and slowly heat the pan up, if the salmon sizzles lightly then the pan is at the right tempreture. Once its in don't touch it and watch the color, once its a rosy pink and easy to pick up (not sticking to the pan) you can flip it. Cook until the rest of the fish is rosy pink.

1oocpaa,"Finally Trying Dragon Age: The Veilguard After a Year, Surprisingly good?",1762275769.0,0,0,False,"So, The Veilguard had a… let’s say bumpy launch. Sales weren’t terrible, but it definitely didn’t land with what BioWare probably hoped for. A lot of the early discourse was messy too some people judged the game almost entirely based on a few viral clips and turned it into yet another “woke debate,” which didn’t help the game at all.

I personally stayed away for a while because the art direction and some of the dialogue I saw pre-launch didn’t really click with me. I decided to wait for a solid discount or for it to hit Game Pass like a true patient gamer and here we are, one year later.

First off: credit where it’s due. The game is extremely well optimized, pretty much bug-free, and looks fantastic. Character movement feels smooth and weighty in a very satisfying way.

\-Combat: Enjoying it so far: dynamic, readable, varied enough to stay fun (I started as an Elf Warrior). Managing companions is easy and enjoyable too. It’s not as tactical as Origins (but let’s be honest, Inquisition wasn’t either, and I still liked that).

\-Level Design & Exploration: This might be my favorite part so far. It’s not open-world bloat; it’s more like a God of War style semi-linear structure, with tight, handcrafted areas. I like this choice.

\-Loot: Less of it, but more meaningful, big + for me.

\-RPG Elements: Definitely on the lighter side. “RPG-lite” feels like the right description.

\-Companions & Banter: So far, charming and engaging. Their interactions on the road have been solid.

And honestly, the fact that my first 10 hours flew by and felt like 2 hours says something.

At this point, I think The Veilguard is pretty underrated. I have a feeling it will be appreciated more with time, especially now that people can approach it free from the launch day noise. A well timed new content next year could definitely give it another boost too.

Between the polished technical launch, fluid combat, great level design, good enough dialogue, enjoyable exploration, and amazing environmental visuals, it’s already above what I expected. To be fair, the negative discourse over the last year probably pushed my expectations down so that might be influencing things too.

Anyone else trying The Veilguard now that it’s been a year and its on Game Pass?

-Very well crafted open world with some solid and rewarding exploration and resource gathering/crafting without feeling tedious. Side missions are crafted care and make sense instead of being cookie cutter box checkers. 


-Well paced progression as you slowly become more powerful and capable of taking on hordes thanks to some well designed variety of combat options. 


-Combat offers numerous strategies as you go, from traps, custom melee weapons, explosives(exploding knives are so so satisfying), to guns that give you just enough ammo to use now and then when you really need them. 


-Melee mechanics feel really nice and enemy variety is solid considering it’s either zombies or the occasional group of humans. It’s simple but feels great. Aiming for body parts works well as the controls are accurate and there are some brutal finishers. Not the to the same degree as Dead Island 2 but it gets the job done. 


-Level and world design are really impressive. There are a lot of buildings to explore, both small and large, some underground areas, open spaces, etc.  


-Parkour mechanics are great, and getting around the world doesn’t take too long. If you need to travel longer distances it’s it too hard to find a car. 


-Beast mode is satisfying without being too overpowered. 


-World size feels perfect and the setting feels refreshing. 


As someone who’s suffering from open world fatigue I’d say Techland has done an amazing job here creating a well made and well balanced zombie game. Not sure how well it’s selling but I don’t see much conversation around which is a shame.

The one game that comes to mind is Nier Automata, but that game is pretty depressing, so it's not exactly great for a de-stressing session after work.

The Horizon games have nice worlds to explore and relax in, but they're primarily focused on ranged combat. The Arkham games are set in Gotham which is fairly dreary. The Spiderman games are set in New York which isn't what I'm looking for.

The closest total package that I can really think of are the Breath of the Wild games, but I find the combat a bit lacking in those games. They're great for other reasons, but I don't really want to deal with the equipment management of them.

Souls-likes feel too heavy and slow in their combat. I just want to mash a bit and pull off some flashy stuff with relative ease.

Nothing anyone has put any real effort into, at least.

For those that weren't around; this arcade game was a phenomenon and likely a large reason why the show became as popular as it did in the first place. It was a technical marvel at the time and set a standard for how to treat a popular IP with respect.

That last part is the thing that sparks my intrigue as an adult. How did this Japanese company barely anyone knew (relatively speaking) at the time come out of nowhere and nail the aesthetic and overall soul of the most popular IP of the 90's so damned well?

This was before the proliferation of internet. What did that kind of collaboration even look like?

This game seems to be something of a marvel to me. Two things:

1. I did not realize this thing was in creation during the [first season](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/The_Simpsons_Arcade_Game?utm_source=chatgpt.com), according to some conversations I've seen. This makes me more curious about what the creators wanted from the IP in general.
2. Related to 1: I was in my preteens when this game was released in Arcades, and as such, I think it's been verified by Einstein that there's some kind of time dilation effect that happens during this stage of a person's life - because it felt like ""The Simpsons"" as a franchise had been around *forever at this point*, before I first ran into that Arcade Machine for the first time at ""The Palace"" skating rink all those years ago.

I really need a thorough behind-the-scenes documentary on this thing. Someone please get on this!

Imagine how fucking pathetic you have to be as a human being for wanting to straight shit on someone that just wants to express excitement for talking about the Simpsons due to one throwaway line. The tone of some of these comments are fucking unreal.

These days, I struggle to get hooked on modern titles the same way I did back then.

I spend most of my gaming time using emulators on PC, and while that should scratch the itch, it doesn’t quite do it. Emulators can be hit or miss — some games run beautifully, while others are a complete mess. On top of that, tracking down certain games is a pain. Most of the companies that made them don’t sell them anymore, resellers jack up the prices, and thanks to internet censorship, even finding “free” options is getting harder.

Sony and Microsoft at least make an effort to bring some sixth-gen titles to modern platforms — not all, but a fair few. I’ll give Microsoft credit: they really go the extra mile with smoother performance and visual upgrades on Xbox. Nintendo, on the other hand, will just pick a random game or two, slap an anniversary label on it, and charge a ridiculous amount.

Also, a game where I can only take a few shots before dying, because I'm playing a normal guy, without superpowers.   
- Story: I'm looking for a game where I am fighting a war that makes sense. I'm not looking for shooting just for the sake of shooting.

1olahdf,Got a new idea for a game,1761956372.0,0,0,False,"It's Halloween.  You have a phobia of children and having it interact with people but will give out candy to face your fear.  You have two meters: an anxiety meter and a candy meter.

Parents and kids will come to your door.  If it's one to four kids, you anxiety meter is fine.  It's a whole group of parents with five to twelve kids, your anxiety meter will fill steadily.  When they leave, your anxiety meter will go down slowly.  However, if your anxiety meter gets too high, you'll freak out, run into your house, bolting it and shutting off the front porch light.  

You must also keep track of how much candy you are giving out.  If you run out while more kids are coming, you'll also freak out, lock up the house and shut off the lights, and run to your room.

If you are able to keep calm and manage your candy well, you'll be fine.

All three scenarios that I have listed will have a similar ending with you going to your room and do your annual viewing of Hocus Pocus hoping this year that the Sanderson Sisters will win even though you know they won't.  It's how you've handled things that determines how well you enjoy your viewing, though.

Oh, and there's some freaky dude that you catch watching you every so often.  If it turns 8 'o clock, you have a high anxiety meter and little candy left, he will appear right in front of your face saying ""Do I scare you?""  You have two responses - 1) say yes and get a jump scare that gives your character a heart attack and dies or 2) have your character verbally lash out at the creature by saying ""NO!  NO, YOU DON'T SCARE ME!  I FACED A BUNCH OF LITTLE KIDS WITH GIANT EYES LOOKING UP AT MY 5'10"" 350 LBS MALE PATTERN BALDNESS ASS IN APPREHENSION FOR THE LAST TWO HOURS!  I HAVE FACED MY FEAR!

Stuff like having a left and right hand weapon but also having weapons strapped to your thighs like throwing knives and explosives. 

It would be a Medieval fantasy type game where customizing your body and armor opens up options for exploring dungeons and hunting. 

Think something like a more grounded monster hunter with magic and motion inputs for certain weapon techniques. 

Not sure if I'm explaining this well. 

Basically a melee action adventure game, where the weapon and armor customization functions very similar to the Armored Core games, and melee combat similar to Zelda or Monster Hunter.

1ol6n49,"The sad state of ""Junk car, survival, life simulators""",1761945703.0,0,0,False,"My Summer Car is one of the greatest games ever made. Beneath it's admittedly modest presentation lays a diamond in the rough. Many games let you fix cars and many games let you drive cars but few games let you do both. But it's not just a survival/life simulator game. It's a unique game with great humor that oozes with charm. And it's all made by one guy, which is very impressive. It also somewhat justifies the less than great visual presentation, which to be honest contributes to the game's unique feel. 

There was definitely a good idea there, and one that could be expanded on. Surely enough not long after discovering My Summer Car I discovered another game in the same vein called Jalopy. Much like MSC it too featured a gameplay loop centered around keeping a pile of junk alive, but it expanded on the idea by featuring procedurally generated maps and a bigger focus on story telling. A great, though admittedly short, experience. But fret not, for there was so much that could be done with the groundwork laid, and surely enough games were coming out left and right iterating on the idea and expanding it. All we had to do was just wait for the genre to come into its own. 

And nearly ten years on, it's never really gotten better than that. A quick glance on Steam for simillar games and you're showered with copy cats and clones of pretty much just the two games I mentioned. Some are ok, basically just more of a good thing. Most, however, are just abandoned early access projects with unfulfilled promises and reduced scopes. All way past their full release deadlines, all scaling back down on their initial plans, pretty much none truly expanding on the formula in any particular way. While there are some gems in there, as in games that offer a decent experience, none are really surpassing MSC or Jalopy in what they offer. Jalopy clones are really bad, since the nature of the game means that they're little more than procedurally generated slop with more and more low effort assets dumped into them periodically. MSC clones are even worse, with some standouts like Mon Bazou existing, but there's always some compromise being made. Some look downright horrible despite being fun to play if you get past that. Some are just aimless, with none of the charm or purpose that made MSC great, some are just straight up copies. You can only brew moonshine and run rallies so many times before it gets boring. 

I guess I'm just venting here. I understand that most of these games are single person projects and it's an uphill battle to bring a project like that to completion, but I can't help but feel sad that games like MSC and Jalopy gave me an itch I can't scratch. Despite seemingly being interest in the genre, no one has actually come around to fill that demand. I recently played Junkyard Truck which was cool and all for a few hours but I soon realised that what I was playing was more or less what we're getting. Dev has no real plans to expand the game much further and it's not long after you get over the early game that you find yourself to be roaming aimlessly.

1okkhkz,The Outer Worlds 2 - A mixed review after the first 15 hours,1761882141.0,86,0,False,"I went into The Outer Worlds 2 with optimism. I wasn’t a huge fan of the first game even tough I finished it. TOW2 tries a bit too hard with the “comedy,” feels kind of bland overall, and the combat leans too much into bullet spongy enemies for my taste. Still, I was curious to see if Obsidian would take things up a notch later.

Unfortunately, even though The Outer Worlds 2 is technically better than the first, it’s not much of a step up. It still lags behind Obsidian’s older games in terms of storytelling, character writing, and quest design. The world just doesn’t have that spark, it feels like a prettier (but not that pretty) version of what we already got. I think I liked what they did with Avowed better.

The gameplay is definitely smoother, and I can’t deny it’s a solid classic-style RPG where you can build your character and approach quests however you want. There’s a certain charm to the setting and tone, and when it clicks, it does remind me why Obsidian is still respected in the RPG space.

But overall, it feels very formulaic. The factions, the choices, the open ended perks and weaknesses,it all funnels toward the same kinds of outcomes, and it never really surprises you. The humor still feels forced, and the story doesn’t grab you the way it should.

In a year full of great RPGs, I just can’t justify spending or money on something that feels this familiar. It’s not bad just uninspired. But I already have Gamepass and no other game on my list at the moment which is why I am still trying to find the spark. 

I think the critics score is a bit high tbh, I would give it a solid 7.

TL;DR: The Outer Worlds 2 is a competent sequel that plays well but plays it too safe. Better than the first, sure, but still missing that special spark that made Obsidian’s older games memorable.

1okiivd,Used Halliday to buy a Valorant skin on payments and instantly regretted it,1761876264.0,0,0,False,"I tried this new thing called Halliday that lets you buy now and pay later for in-game stuff. It sounded harmless at first. I was low on cash but really wanted one of the new Valorant skins, the Oni Phantom bundle, so I figured I’d just split it up. It cost around $80 total, and they offered a plan that was $30 up front and the rest over the next couple of months.

For about a week everything worked fine. Then my next payment date came and I completely forgot about it. The charge failed, and when I logged into Valorant the skin was gone. No warning, no “your payment failed,” just missing from my locker like it never existed.

I emailed Halliday support and they replied a day later saying I would regain access once the account was in good standing. That was it. No time frame, no help, nothing. So now I have paid $30, don’t have the skin, and feel like an idiot for financing pixels.

I get that it was my fault for missing the payment, but it still feels shady that a service can just reach into your account and take away something you already paid part of. I didn’t even know that was possible.

If anyone here is thinking about trying Halliday to grab skins or loot boxes, seriously just wait until you can afford it. The idea of game now pay later sounds fun until you realize it is basically microtransactions on credit.

Steam says that it was used in development but ""*In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team.""* Which means nothing. That's like saying you asked Chat-GPT to make a photo and since you put the prompt in, the finished product reflects your ""expressions and creativity"".

Some [articles](https://tech.yahoo.com/gaming/articles/arc-raiders-devs-don-t-150959107.html) are saying they DON'T use GenAI other than the AI Voices, *""AI text-to-speech is instead what Strandberg calls a ""studio strategy"" to punch above its weight. ""We are trying to maximize what we can, being a small team trying to get make rich worlds right, but still staying small... but we don't use generative AI in other domains across the game,"" he added.""*

So what the hell was used? I mean besides the obvious AI voices, which are atrocious. How can you use Generative AI but then claim it's not in any of the games content, besides the ""voice acting"" which IS generative AI. If concept art, script, hell, even code is AI written, how can you claim that's ethical? And more importantly, why doesn't anyone care anymore?

The story is okay, but it's a somewhat disappointing campaign, I suppose. At the beginning, it does look very promising with interesting characters, the setting, and the plot, until it goes a bit stale during its climax and through to the end.  The overall gameplay loop was very fun, but it becomes more repetitive towards the end, and plus there's the lack of variety in splatterkills. The controls were a little bit stiff at times, especially during the platforming sections. The soundtrack is super great and fits very well during the fighting against enemies or bosses. The overall atmosphere is great and has its unique look to it, but it is definitely missing the eerie vibes from the original trilogy games. The three classic games included are a nice bonus.

But here's the thing about generations - **each console generation is far shorter than anyone's childhood**. I had a Spectrum, an Amiga, a GBC, an N64 and a PS1 'as a kid' and when I first started uni and played shit loads of couch multiplayer I had at various time a GC, an Xbox and a PS2. When I was a young adult and living in a flatshare we had a Wii in the living room and used to have great party nights playing it. Any and all of the above inspire huge amounts of nostalgia for me.

And yet, if someone says the 6th gen (and the GC in particular seems to encourage this comment the most) was the best, there will almost certainly be people going: Oh, that's just nostalgia. But why would I have more nostalgia for gaming in my late teens/early twenties than in high school or even younger when friends would come round after class to play together. And for someone five years younger than me, why would it be vice versa?

Anyone who played games from a relatively young age will likely have at least three generations of consoles that they played in what will now be looked back on as nostalgia inducing times of their life. So nostalgia doesn't really explain anything other than that what's available now isn't their favourite (and or course, if anyone were to claim a current console was their favourite, well that would just be dismissed as ""recency bias"").

The majority of people can understand and make account for their own nostalgia. When they say they think console X or generation Y was the greatest, people should just accept that at face value.",True

Today we’re here for an AMA about the game, the dev journey, and a Halloween experiment we just launched.

**Who we are**

* Small indie VR studio; no publisher, limited budget, very active with our community.
* We’re obsessed with high-ceiling combat systems where mastery really matters.
* Proof we’re us: \[devs will reply from this account + can add lightweight proof in a mod-approved comment if needed\].

**What’s new (Halloween Community Challenge: Oct 24 – Nov 2)**  
We rebuilt one of our bosses—**Mekarion**—for a limited event:

* More health, smarter attack patterns, and new mechanics.
* No shops or grinding, straight to the fight.
* **Twist:** he can’t be beaten in one run. Mekarion has a **global health bar** shared by everyone. Every attempt from any player chips away at the same boss. Think “raid boss energy” in a single-player VR game.

**How it works**

* **When:** Oct 24, 9:00 AM PT through Nov 2, 11:59 PM PT.
* **Attempts:** 3 per day per player; each attempt deals damage to Mekarion’s global HP.
* **Rewards if he dies in time:** all participants get an exclusive wand (**The Dreadmaw**).
* **Top contributors:** the 10 highest total damage dealers get **Mekarion’s flaming skull** as a permanent trophy.

**Why we built it**

  
We wanted HexWind to feel **alive -** events that respond to the community, not just patch notes. As a small team, we can try weird ideas fast. If this lands, we’ll keep going: more community raid bosses, asynchronous PvP events, and regular design/balance chats with players.

**Ask us anything about**

* Designing high-skill magic combat for VR (input mapping, readability, comfort).
* Building a roguelite that’s hard but fair.
* The tech behind a global boss in a single-player game (tracking, anti-cheese, data).
* Content cadence for a tiny team (what we cut, what we shipped, what we learned).
* The business side of indie VR (pricing, wishlists, store pages, and reality checks).
* Post-launch balance and how community feedback changes our roadmap.

We’ll be here **today** answering live for several hours and will check back later for stragglers. We’ll keep links to a minimum; if mods are OK with it, we’ll drop a single comment with optional community hubs for those who want to coordinate runs.

Thanks for reading and for supporting indie VR whether you play HexWind or just want to talk shop, we’re all ears.

1oizwwo,Review after around 20 hours in Outer Worlds 2,1761730150.0,683,0,False,"It's wild that Outer Worlds 2 has basically zero hype. The first Outer Worlds never really clicked with me, it sort of felt like a knockoff Fallout in a way, but TOW2 is clicking waaay more.

Playing on Xbox Series X and its suprisingly good looking and bug-free, especially considering I was playing it for review before the latest patches and early access. Playing on performance mode the most because it actually doesn't feel like much of a difference from quality or balanced (I did a bunch of screenshots to compare and they're honestly so similar). The smaller handcrafterd areas are great. There aren’t a gazillion empty planets to slog through like in Starfield, which honestly just makes me realise more and more that Starfield really should have gone the same way.

My memory is a bit rusty on the first game, but it basically feels like it does all the same things as the first game, just like... better. The gunplay’s fine, nothing special, but it feels good. Stealth is kinda janky, and I was bummed that hacking is just a skill thing with no mini-game. But where Outer Worlds 2 really surprised me is how much theyv'e stuck to the RPG side of things, it's not dummed down into a shooter, it's like a proper RPG, with lots of reading and talking and makes what skills you pick really feel like they matter. Could be good for replayablitlity.

I don't think this is going to be a GOTY contender or anything, but I’ve really been enjoying my time with it. Interested in hearing what fans of the first game think, since I wasn't.

**Edit for Quick Notes:** 

1. The first line about zero hype was actually speaking more to how Microsoft have barely made any major effort to market the game's release. Evident even in all the ""Oh is it out?"" comments (that said, its still valid that the first game didn't do much to inspire major excitement). 
2. Getting some flak for this, so I just want to be clear: No, this is not my full comprehensive review of the game, it's just a short casual post based on my review, around my experience with the game and to open the door for conversation in the comments.
3. Third point is an excuse to say that I hope you have fun and play awesome games that you love, ok bye.",True

I intentionally never save in an elevator. If I'm about to save and realize I'm in one, I purposefully step out. And I realized I've done that in every game with elevators for some time now.


The reason? Back when the OG Mass Effect came out, there was an awful bug where if you saved on an elevator and then loaded that save, you'd be stuck in the elevator forever with no way to escape. And if that was your only save, or only recent save, you were SOL.


I've never heard of that issue in any other game, but Mass Effect burned it into my head that you *do not* save in an elevator.

Before, it was very unlikely to get a throwing weapon kill, because it was hard enough to actually land one, and even if you did, it would basically never kill unless it was a sledgehammer or an ax to the chest or head. Now, they're all actually viable tactics, with the Pitchfork being the best because it throws and travels faster, and the shovel being the second best. But there's a lot of satisfaction from landing a thrown wood axe or the thunk of a sledgehammer.

Small changes, but they allow for something like this to be organized and it's so cool and I really wish I could play something like this.

Now before you jump on me hear me out. Studios can continue to pay the developers for releasing patches in case of botched releases and they will have an incentive to work towards bettering the product .

People stop buying the game and the planned patch releases never go out due to funding crunch. 

Now if they release ads in-game they can make money out of it and continue supporting developers.

1oia8oq,How long should a hard section in a game last max?,1761660212.0,0,0,False,"So as someone who likes challenge in the games, sometimes they can be extremely annoying.

The final levels of Mario games usually offers a difficult level for instance but I never got frustrated or gave up. They are just the perfect instances of repeat the segments until you achieve. 

But I can't say the same things for NES games for example. Theoretically, they are the same logic, try until you achieve. But the biggest problem with this is the lack of saves. You just need to start over the whole game and the loss of progress just makes you lose motivation of progressing. Not to mention NES games takes around 2-3 hours usually which means a big loss considering this time is the average gametime for a day for most people! And hardest sections in NES games is almost always the last parts. So you need to play 2 hours to be able to practice that part only and obviously you fail and start all over as if you never played. And there are always more than one hard section in the game. 

When the loss of progression is 5-10 minutes when you fail, it doesn't seem to feel like you lose a progress and you practice and repeat until you achieve and you beat it, you feel like you accomplish it.

I hate the games when they limit saves for this reason the most. They try to give you a challenge with it but it only frustrates people since one mistake can cause you days of playing time. Not to mention you might not be able to put the game down when you want it to continue later. 

What are your thoughts about this? Do you like this kind of challenges or does it just frustrate you when you can't save at all to unlock something in a game? ",True

That magazine help the boy beat the game once.  Once.

Going through the magazine, imagine the boy's surprise and horror to find a preview of the NES version of the computer game The Uninvited (collage of pics from that Nintendo Power preview attached).  Scared the living hell out of him.

Same month, the boy is with his grandma at the supermarket and he's flipping through an issue of Gamepro when he comes across an ad for [Zombie Nation](https://www.heypoorplayer.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nes_zombie_nation_ad-765x1024.jpg) for the NES.

First off, no it doesn't work well.  We tried playing 4 games, 2 at 2 player, 2 at 4 player, and we had a 50% success rate.  Random player drops, duplicate players, disconnection.  It's sad, but really, even when it crashed the absurdity of it all makes it.  

  
How it works - Players are divided into 2 teams a prosecution and a defense.  1 player is the defendant, one player is the plaintiff, and the rest are witnesses.  The court is ruled by AI Snoop.  AI Snoop may be insane.  Snoop calls on people to give testimony or describe a scene and then renders his judgement.  It rarely makes scene but really, I'm not playing to win, I'm playing for insanity.  

The game starts with everyone just telling a story about themselves.  It doesn't have to do with anything.  Tell a dumb story.  After everyone tells a story Snoop picks out a few things and makes a case out of it.  I'm pretty sure the case will be a dumb civil matter, any mention of murder is ignored I think.  

So our cases -

The plaintiff was suing because the organizer of the donkey race he was part of used Disposable plates that weren't eco friendly.  The defense made the case that the plates were made of compressed hay and that the donkeys ate them after but Snoop didn't buy it.  Later the idea of Donkey races being a Mexican tradition came up but snoop ruled that environmentalism was better than tradition.

The second Case crashed before we really got into it

The Third case (our first with 4) was that the defendant ate all the Shrek popsicles that were used to prepare the donkeys before the big donkey race.  Snoop enjoyed and believed the expert testimony that Donkeys run faster after eating Shrek popsicle, but then the game crashed.  

The final case was that the defendant owned a pirate themed cruise ship and didn't pay the defendant their full wages because they shorted the company on an order of lemons.  That was the case Snoop came up with, don't ask me.  Snoop didn't seem to care about invoices, scurvy, the use of oranges in place of lemons or any argument.  The plaintiff won, even though the pirate crew got scurvy.  A travesty of justice.

In some cases you are asked to describe a scene and then some AI art of what you described pops up as evidence.  The quality of the pictures is poor.  The accuracy of the picture is extremely poor.  The pictures look like an absurd fever dream and they always made us laugh at the insanity of it all.

Overall, this isn't a game, it's a really shitty AI that spews nonsense and it's hilarious.  Nothing matter, Snoop is insane, the AI art is absurd, the whole whing is a wild ride that rarely makes sense, often crashes, but yet, I love it and want to play again.  Also it's the rare Jackbox style game that works great with just 2 people.

When I bought my wheel last year, there was only one game I really had in mind: Dirt Rally 2. I also got Project Cars 2 and Assetto Corsa, the latter kind of as an afterthought, thinking it would be quite boring. 

Fast forward a tumultuous year, and I haven't got to spend much time with it yet. I finally got a bit of breathing room and enough motivation to set up the wheel again, and I arrive at one conclusion: I suck at rally. It's enjoyable, yes, but it leaves me exhausted, and I crash more often than anything. 

Project Cars never quite hooked me. In part it was probably due to the game acting weirdly with my wheel. That aside, it never really got me interested for some reason. 

So here I was, low key regretting my purchase, when I decided to fire up Assetto Corsa for the first time, because why not?

I came to yet another conclusion: I suck at driving on tracks too. But boy, this is fun! 

Driving in this game is simply *fun* in a way I can't describe. It feels satisfying to take corners with the wheel. After a couple of graphical mods, it looks brilliant too. There's even a little career mode. The AI is ridiculous, but who needs AI when driving around an empty track is this fun? 

This is a game that lets me drive around in all the cars I could want. I inevitably go off track but it's less annoying than in rally. There's always the desire to improve when I look at hotlaps and find how laughably abysmal my time is compared to the best times. 

And, there are mods. I spent some time modding in the Shutoko Expressway and other free roam maps like Targa Florio. I can now drive around to my heart's content looking at the scenery, simply lost in the pleasure of driving. 

It's been a long time since a game made me feel like this. It brings back childhood memories of when I used to spend countless hours flying around in modded airplanes in Microsoft Flight Simulator X. My adult self hasn't experienced anything close to this. 

For all I know this will fizzle out. I'll grow tired of driving and move on to other games. But this discovery is something I'll cherish, and from time to time, I'll pop back in for a relaxed drive around the Nürburgring in a simple car. ",True

1ohf5kz,The differences in the amount of time people have to game really causes issues for Devs,1761573552.0,1150,0,False,"First of all, this isn’t meant as a criticism of anyone who has the time to dedicate long hours to gaming. I completely understand that people enjoy different playstyles and have varying amounts of free time. However, I’ve noticed a growing trend on Reddit that I find quite interesting — and a little concerning — when it comes to how quickly players consume games today.

Across various gaming subreddits, I often see posts almost immediately after a game’s release asking about downloadable content, expansions, or New Game+ modes. It feels as though many players rush through the base game so fast that they’re already looking ahead for something more before others have even finished the main story.

This year, for example, I’ve been playing *Kingdom Come: Deliverance II*, *Ghosts of Yotei*, *Ball X Pit*, and the usual *FIFA* sessions with friends. In each of those communities, I’ve seen countless threads along the lines of “Where’s the DLC?”, “When is New Game+ coming?”, or “I’ve already max-leveled my character.” Meanwhile, I’m still working my way through the main storyline, far from 100% completion.

I usually play for about one to two hours most evenings, which I think puts me in the range of an average player. Yet it sometimes feels like the gaming world moves at a completely different pace — one where people finish massive, content-rich games within days and are immediately eager for more.

It’s not a complaint, exactly — just an observation about how gaming habits have evolved. With the abundance of content and constant updates in modern games, it seems many players are less inclined to savor the experience and more focused on what’s next.

1og1sy4,Soul Calibur III - A remembrance and a lament,1761424171.0,38,0,False,"Today marks the 20th anniversary of the release of Soul Calibur III.  I still remember going to the video store to rent it.  It was raining that day and a bit foggy, perfect day to be inside a playing a video game.  My mother asked me what game I rented and I told her saying that it was ""kind of like The Three Musketeers"", which my mom would have known from the movie with Gene Kelly and Lana Turner.  Except The Three Musketeers didn't have a samurai, a lady wearing next to nothing wielding a chain whip sword, lizardmen, a couple of eldritch abominations, and is actually set 30 years prior to the events of Alexander Dumas' story.

I liked that challenge the game gave you in having to go through multiple playthroughs to unlock all the characters.  I even had a strategy guide that had all the characters moves and I mean all of them.  Big, huge thing it was.  Only thing it lacked was a guide for each character's path to fighting Night Terror.  And when I did encounter that thing, it would more often than not wipe the floor with me like I was a janitor's push broom.  But you would get a good amount of in game money to spend if you beat him.

And then there's the voice cast - Crispin Freeman, Eden Riegel, Kari Wahlgren, Keith Silverstein.  A very solid voice acting cast.  

That brings me to the next and best feature the game had - create a Soul.  The first of the series to have it.  You could buy armor and clothing and things to make your own fighter.  Yeah, you actually had to purchase your equipment to make your character and what you equipped you character with effected how well their offence and defense was in battle.  This wasn't just a cosmetic thing.

Tied to create a Soul was Soul Calibur III's second best feature - an original story not connected to our world.  You created your character from a set of classes and the higher your original character got in level, another character class would be unlocked, and the higher level two classes other classes got you would unlock the highest class levels.  Also, these levels came with their own class of weapons that the main Soul Calibur cast couldn't use like grieves and battle fans and tambourines.

And that's where the lament comes in.  Soul Calibur III was as far as they could have gone with the main cast.  The story mode being set in a fictional fantasy world is where they should have gone for the sequels.  They could have done so much more with that.  They could have still had the main fighters but they would come from made up countries on a made up world.  But, no, we still had to be set on Earth with cheap as characters like Hilde easily able to do ""ring outs"".

So, sales and quality for the series declined.  And with Team Soul disbanded, it looks like the six Soul Calibur will be the last, the characters sent off to the Namco Vault, which in my mind is a combo of The Disney Vault, a Vault from Fallout with the evil experiments, and the Island of Misfit Toys from Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.  A depressing thought, but a sad reality.  I did say there was a lament.  Now the only Souls games Bandai Namco releases are ones where you really need to be good at dodging and timing or you'll die easily.

Tl:dr Soul Calibur III was great and the series is very much missed.  A lot of potential unrealized causing it to get to get stuck in a rut along with guest characters that weren't needed nor were a big draw brought the series to its end...for now.",True

It seems so weird to me, I am that strong vampire who can one punch a thief, or a robber, which is also annoying cause I cannot normally punch so I could just stun him or smth, not smash like a hulk. 
But when I am attacked by same kind of enemies, not vampires , they suddenly become stronger so when they block damaged reduced significantly, while they block with bare hands. To evade enemies attack I can only dash/dodge . 

Am I missing something? I just don’t get it, blocking would make this game too easy? Make enemies stronger, smarter . 

I can use telekinesis (q key) , but it’s so poorly executed , after first pull, enemies can resist vampires abilities somehow.

And recently, Alan Wake 2. There is a point where the story and gameplay start to blur, you do not know what is real anymore. It is less scary and more deeply unsettling, like losing control inside your own mind.

1oea25i,Are classic style games unpopular with gamers or just devs?,1761241760.0,0,0,False,"I've been looking into a lot of newer games and I've noticed everything has pretty much been streamlined into the same ""modernized""  experience. Even popular classic franchises have abandoned their roots and made some attempt to reinvent themselves which has led to their original niche disappearing from the current market entirely. 

Shooters:

Arena - Halo I think would be a good example to start with. I feel like all shooters these have become always exclusively tactical shooters geared towards a competitive experience. I had a lot of trouble articulating exactly how Halo dropped for me until I started replaying old 90's arena shooters like Quake, Doom, and Marathon and experienced some of that old magic. I began to realize that Halo 3 was the last holdout of the classic era of arena shooter, and that Halo 3 had more in common with Quake II than it does Halo Infinite. I can't remember where it came from but I do remember seeing an ad that said ""We're not making your dad's shooter"" and it's almost like there's a disdain there in the gaming industry for the classics. 

Light Gun/Rail Shooters - I see a few of these get made for VR and Arcades exclusively but I almost never see them for home console releases. I think the Wii was the last console to really represent this game type, but I have a lot of fond memories of Light Gun games Judge Dredd, Star Fox, Star X! Light Gun games have always had trouble hitting home media and it's sad to see that hasn't changed much. Gundam: Final Shooting, Jurassic Park, the Star Wars Trilogy, and more recently Halo Fireteam Raven were all pretty good and unfortunately live and die with the accessibility of local arcades.  I think Light Gun games are even more fun for couch co-op than other shooter genres because you don't have to split screens for multiplayer. 

RPGs/Side Scrollers:

RPGs - The core issue with the modernization of these games is they've all become 3D. Pokemon as an example had a chibi overworld artstyle that really couldn't be replicated well in 3D, but there's also the cost increase of making a 3D game tanking the quality of the game itself. A lot of the features older games offered freely like Battle Tower/Frontiers and Safari Zones are removed and repackaged as DLC. There's even fewer games being made per generation. I hear a lot of people even today say Emerald was one of the best Pokemon games out there with only Platinum possibly rivaling it. I feel like staying largely 2D might've been a better move for the franchise both aesthetically and for the overall quality of the product.

Side Scrollers - I believe it was games like Mario, Zelda, and Sonic that popularized this medium, but I gravitated more towards Castlevania and Alien Hominid. These games definitely have a charm of their own that I can't really describe, but I do miss the genre, and honestly the bits as well. Bit art was always something that was very appealing to me.

I think the devs in the current game industry have ultimately moved past old genres for the sake of trend chasing and technical progress, and I don't think they considered if gamers have really had enough of these old genres. I know I haven't at least.

Edit: Indie isn't really an answer for why mainstream devs aren't making classic style games. Indie Devs are the underground, grassroots studios. Their work isn't always accessible to every gamer, and the vast majority of indie games aren't console compatible. Consider more than just the PC gamer",True

This is scary not just for indie developers (most of whom bore the brunt of this), but also for the future of the industry and us, the customers.

Stats:

Nearly 13,000 games have been released since January 1, 2025 (currently, a little over 12,732).

As of today, Steam has seen an estimated 12,732 games released in 2025.

40% of Steam games (over 5,000 games) failed to recoup $100 (which is the fee required to put your game in Valve's Steam store).

Over 8,000 (8,388 or 65.9% of 2025 releases) games are estimated to have earned under $1,000 (which is NOTHING, especially if they have employees, even if this is one developer, they can't live off of $1,000/year whether in the US or even a developing country)

47.4% are estimated to have sold under 100 copies, with 28% estimated between 100 and 1,000 copies.

8% of the releases are estimated to have grossed over $100,000.

The bottom 30% of games by revenue averaged just $37 in apparent gross.

In other games, like Streets of Rage, Full Metal Furies, or Cuphead I kill most of the enemies and she feels like she is not contributing. Many co-op games emphasize the skills of singular players, but others like the ones in the title, found a way to make the act of collaboration a skill in itself. I have noticed a trend in many co-op games that have applied this philosophy and I think that this design principle bypasses the skill problem so elegantly, that it should have a name. It could be a name such as Voltron-likes, or Megazorg-likes, where two (or more) players take control of a single entity. In the case of Overcooked it's a single kitchen and in the case of Lovers in a Dangerous Spacetime, it's a spaceship. What do you guys think about giving a name to the genre?

1odunzw,Current State of Consoles,1761196048.0,0,0,False,"I think this really shows something about the state of gaming currently, especially about the current crop of console games. I know there was the whole covid pandemic at the start of this generation, but I don't think it fully accounts for what we are seeing here.

PlayStation 4 released Christmas 2013 and the PlayStation 5 released Christmas 2020. So we can say roughly the PS4 had 7 years of it being the big Sony offering and main platform out in the wild.

If you look at the list of best selling PS4 games; Spideman sold 22.7 million, God or War was 21 mil, Horizon Zero Dawn 19.3 mil, Uncharted 4 18.6 mil, The Last of Us 18.6 mil. Those are all Sony Interactive Entertainment games. Other games on the best selling list that aren't Sony produced or cross platform titles like COD BO3 15 mil and COD MW 13.6 mil, Red Dead Redemption 2 14 mil, Witcher 3 10.8 mil, Bloodborne 7.6 mil. 

Now look at the list of PS5 games. Number 1 is Spiderman 2 (which was also a pack in game for a bit), it sold 11 million. Number 2 is Black Myth Wukong at 5 mil and then Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart at 4 mil. Fourth place is Elden Ring at 3.7 mil and rounding out the top 5 is Final Fantasy XVI at 3 mil.

The PS5 is just about to celebrate 5 years on the market. That is over 70% of what we called the PS4's lifetime. PS5s top selling game would be the 13th best selling game on PS4's list. PS5's second highest selling game would be 28th on PS4's. PS5's third would be PS4's 33rd. And it just goes way down from there.

True PS5 has sold 80 million units against the PS4's 113 million and still has 2 years left. But the sales difference of about 30 million consoles doesn't justify how little PS5 software has sold.

The other difference is the names. All those big selling PS4 games are IPs that defined that generation or the ones before. IPs that are etched into history as some of the biggest franchises in all of gaming. I would struggle really coming up with much if you asked me to say which games I thought defined the PS5 as a platform or the 2020s as a whole. There have been no new franchises that have launched on PS5 and become a sensation or title that people NEED to buy a PS5 for. Obviously this could change and new games could come out and explode in sales over the next 2 years, but I doubt it.

Is it the costs and complexity of new hardware that is preventing huge selling memorable games? Does it just take too long and be too much of an investment on the current level of technology? Are people losing interest in console games or games in general? How does this bode for the next generation of hardware like a PS6 that we might start hearing details of soon if the 7 year per generation rule holds that is bound to be more expensive and complicated?",True

For you number rating people have a 9.11037/10. My GOTY.

This review contains minor spoilers (route names, minor plot details).


**Prelude:**

The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy - is a Visual Novel*/SRPG*. It’s a game by Tookyo Games, a new small studio created by Danganronpa creator Kazutaka Kodaka and Zero Escape/AITSF creator Kotaro Uchikoshi, two legends in the Adventure VN world. This game promised to feature 100 endings that appear based on choices you made during the story. It would combine the elements of Despair inducing events from Danganronpa and Extreme Scenarios from Zero Escape with its tagline ""Extreme X Despair"". The game almost threw the studio into bankruptcy, and the studio’s survival depended on the game’s success. 

I don't want to say the game is a ""hidden gem"", as it has a niche audience, but it has not been one of the prominent releases this year. The game released the same day as the critically acclaimed game Clair Obscur - Expedition 33. While both games are RPGs, they didn't have much audience overlap. The developers did advertise each other online, so that probably canceled out any possible negative effects. Currently few major review outlets have reviewed it, but it is sitting at a nice 84 on Metacritic and won the Excellence Award at the Japan Game Awards.

I personally played the game day one as I am a pretty big fan of Danganronpa's mysteries and the, frankly, craziness of the creator. The things that happen in those games you won't find anywhere else. The charm continued into his spiritual successor Master Detective Archives: Raincode, and while the mysteries weren't as well done, I loved the characters and world. I was excited for his next game that was a collaboration with the creator of another series I liked with Zero Escape, although at the time I only played 999.

Onto the game review

**Positives:**

Story:

Wildly inconsistent, but some routes have the most brilliant writing l've seen from some of these writers. Those routes make this game my GOTY. The Sci-Fi explanations, mysteries unraveled, history learned, psychological breaks, and character interactions are all so entertaining. Can't go into much detail without spoiling though.

The routes span so many genres so it's hard to get bored of the story itself. Sci Fi, Mystery, Comedy, Romance, Horror, Teenage Dream. It was surprising how many types of stories they fit into one game. I wish they went even wilder (where's my musical route).

Cast:

Main: 

The whole cast, like is normal for Kodaka games, is a bunch of exaggerated tropes. The gang biker, the mechanic, the rich girl, the guy with a negative amount of ego, etc. Then they are given something to make them a little more complex, and these are revealed and deepened through your time with them. There's the Monokuma like mascot Sirei, who is probably the most interesting mascot in a Kodaka game, and I really enjoyed his screentime (and his music too). The one character I have to congratulate the most though is the main character, Takumi Sumino. He has to go through so many different scenarios, and he adapts to all of them well. He isn't some blank slate self insert, he's an actual character. Is he the most unique? No, he's the straight man and ""normal guy"", but he is a character with complex morals and understandable reasoning. Seeing how his psyche is challenged in the routes is really entertaining.

Villains: 

The Supreme Commander of the Invaders >!V'ehxness!<, in the >!Route 0, V'ehxess and 2nd Scenario!< routes specifically, may be the best villain of the year. Her presence is undeniable, her dialogue is amazing, and she is a threat to the party. She also does a lot of
""aura farming"", her transformation sequences being super cool no matter how often I see them. Also I just love her design.

The Invaders having their own functional language is cool, reminding me of Lies of P and Nier. 

Other major villains are amazing but are too spoilery to go into detail on here. 


Gameplay:

The strategy gameplay is pretty fun when you first start. A game where it's beneficial to kill your units? Interesting. Learning how to absolutely burn a boss as much as you can in one turn is awesome. New units joining adding new strategies to utilize too.

Art:

 This game boasts over 2000 full body sprites and around 600 CGs (unique scenes) which is a ton. Most of them look really good, although the Switch did pixilate them a bit on the larger ones.

Voice Acting:

 I personally played the dub. Sparse as it is, it is extremely entertaining. Whenever battles occurred it was something I looked forward to as voice acting was guaranteed in that case. The VAs gave so much personality to everyone. Takumi’s, Kurara’s, Tsubasa’s, Sirei’s, and The Supreme Commander’s being the ones that stand out the most to me.

Music:

Unsurprisingly good. It sounds exactly like how Danganronpa did, with some more “rock fantasy” style tracks for battles. There’s also some music that knocked by socks off that played for special occasions. 


**Negatives:**

Note a lot of these only appeared to me after 120 or so hours.

Story:

Wildly inconsistent. There are routes that seemingly have no reason for existing other than just to waste your time as they have such little payoff.

A lot of loose ends. Most routes have their own continuity and rules, which is fine, but sometimes they are inconsistent in their own routes. Things are introduced and never resolved since they only exist in that route.

There is an issue with the 100 Day format.
Most routes try to stretch their short stories out to 100 days even though they really don't need to be. This leads to a lot of days being any of the following: Free Time (Persona but less stuff), pointless explorations, or getting dribbles of plot over days that could've been said in one scene. One of the biggest examples of this is the >!Comedy Route!<, which is over 100 days long. This is because it splits at multiple points, and these splits also go 100 days, adding a ton of free time days and making the endings (basically one running gag) go on for far too long. They could've easily compressed all of these bits into one 100 day line and made it way more dense and enjoyable.

Battles are always on the same day. There's never any tension of ""what if the enemies attack today"". The player knows exactly what day they will attack and who after their first ending. The characters may not know, but the player does.

Writing style inconsistencies. Routes were written by a bunch of different people. So not only does the style of writing change but also the characterizations and plot structure. This can be jarring sometimes. Uchikoshi’s unique writing style did not shine through much, even on the routes he personally wrote. That kinda disappointed me there.


Cast:

Main: 

Not many issues. If I had one l'd say it's that character development constantly gets reset as you do every run, and not every character gets development in a route (rarely more than 3 beyond Takumi in one route). Some characters like the Tsukumo Twins desperately needed a route to show some growth and emotional strength, but they never really got any.

Villains: 

The Supreme Commander is a laughing stock in a good amount of routes, sometimes on purpose sometimes not. I said she was amazing in some, like best villain of the year, but there's a lot where she is irrelevant. The other Commanders are barely characters and more just faceless monsters beyond one specific route, which I guess an argument could be made that it showed the game's theming to the inhumanity of war, but I just found it boring.


Gameplay:

Nearly every route has the same exact battles on the same exact day, barring some missing units. Making battles extremely repetitive and predictable. While you can skip them if you've done them before, it doesn't make me want to play it. Reaching a point fairly quickly where the game becomes a pure VN as you don't do any SRPG battles anymore (why I italicized SRPG). It's also extremely easy after your first ending, you being able to one turn most waves. The new difficulty that makes it so you get one shot just makes it take a turn longer maybe, not much more difficult.

The exploration minigame is flat out boring.
Mario Party without any fun. You aren't forced to do it often, but when you are IT SUCKS. Just hoping you get high rolls to go faster but not land on an enemy space that won't challenge you but just slow you down. I don't think I ever once volunteered to explore for materials.

Exploring the school isn't very fun in its 2d state, and there's not much to click on for flavor text (a trademark of Uchikoshi games). I found myself just teleporting to every room even within the first route. If it was 3d like Danganronpa I feel it would be more fun to traverse.

Art: 

Lack of environments. You really are at the school 99% of the time likely in the Cafeteria, War Room, or Takumi’s Room. If you are off campus it’s likely one of 5 places and that is extremely rare. The few routes where you spend meaningful time off campus are honestly so refreshing.

A lot of the CGs are clearly outsourced. Some look weird and have inconsistencies with the rest of the game. Artstyle occasionally changes too.

**Tips:**

If you want to play only the amazing stuff and avoid as much as the subpar stuff as possible, I recommend these guides (route name spoilers)

1. >!Route 0->2nd Scenario!< (only doing these makes the game a succinct 60-70 hour long game with good pacing and character development with an amazing ending)

If you want more:

2. >!Slasher, Box of Calamity, Coming of Age, Retsnom, Killing Game, and Mystery -> SF!< (basically every good long route) 

Short stories but really good:

3. >!V’ehxness, Multiple Eitos, and Goodbye Eito!<.

Then play the rest of the routes as you want. Whatever you do DO NOT play the >!Comedy!< route first, it is not worth it. 


**My Takeaway:**

This game is extremely special. There is nothing like it. I can try to analogize it to if you went to a steakhouse and ordered 100 steaks for the price of 1: 30 were bad and immediately thrown out, 50 were fine/good but a bit tough, but 20 were absolutely amazing. Is it worth the price? Absolutely. Is it worth the time to eat all 100? Not for everyone. But what if you could take the steaks home and eat them as you like. It took me until after I took a 4 month break from the game after I burnt out to realize this. I missed the story and characters. Lucky me, I had another 20 hours with them. This made me realize how the creators likely intended the game to be played, as a story you can always return to and experience something new. You make your choices running through a story with this cast, and at the end you reflect ""is this the ending I want?"", if not you keep playing, however if it is you just stop. The game truly isn't meant to be a sprint, but a marathon.

One day the game will draw you back, and you'll have a couple **hundred** of hours of stories to experience with these characters.

e.g you're discussing a roguelite where you die and get stronger and get a little further and then die and get stronger and get a little further and then die and then...? You say you ""enjoyed the core gameplay loop"" did you yeah? If what you're talking about was specifically the gameplay loop. That specifically designed, looping repetitive system? That was the thing you enjoyed? Not the gunplay? the level design? the combat? etc? you enjoyed the loop? Then sure okay go ahead and say that. 

Now let's say you're talking about...metal gear solid 3. You ""enjoyed the core gameplay loop"" did you? What loop? There is none in either a macro or micro scale. There is no looping concepts or factors in that linear story based game, either opaquely speaking or even in a more hidden sense. You can just say that you enjoyed the gameplay. The word ""loop"" need not be involved. Even if you try and conceptualise it and break the game down into needlessly applied game design terms that you're not actually referring to, there isn't really a loop. Going to a new area and then stealthing through to get to the next area, isn't a loop.  

Stop being so keen to consciously or otherwise, reduce all video games to some kind of attention-farming process that simply repeats itself ad infinitum. Stop talking in game design terms that do not necessarily apply just because your favourite reviewers have all inexplicably started using them in the past 5 years and you want to parrot what they say to sound more in-the-know.

I have always interpreted the concept of being able to choose your conversational and character responses as a type of ownership, of your path through the narrative and of your Geralt, Adam Jensen and Shepard.   
  
But I find that ownership is destroyed when a sequel is explicit in going down a path you didn't choose in a previous game.

A Deus Ex example is in Human Revolution It ends with you having the ability to choose to tell the world the truth of what happened, Blame an opposition group, join the Illuminate, or blow up a thing and let things land where they land. (I am being intentionally vague to avoid spoilers).

The sequel decides what choice you made, and if you picked different from what the dev's decided, This isn't your story anymore. It defines the choice you made previously as wrong, or fanfiction in a way.

Witcher is going to do something similar, with 4. The ending of 3 is basically about your character's choices inspiring what kind of woman Ciri she will become (Those choices where very easy to misinterpret at the time though). 

But Witcher 4 will set in stone the cannon of that world is, and again if you didn't choose for her to >!become a witcher!<, then your previous choice becomes invalid.

I know in a practical sense, those choices have to be made. Witcher 4 would be a Civ game if you choose the other ending to canonize, But I think then greater care should be made when offering the initial choice that could define the sequel.

In The Last of Us, there is a calm walk after a hard scene. No fight. No music telling me what to feel. Only footsteps and the wind. I set the controller down and let the silence do the work. It felt honest.

1obqejq,Piecing together the secret formula for Star Citizen.,1760986792.0,0,0,False,"This is something that I never see brought up, but should be brought up more often.

Star Citizen is a controversial and struggling project from CIG games. It is currently a buggy and bad game. People claim its a scam, and they're right, but it is also a game, a bad game, but a game with promise. Yeah, they fleeced people for way too much money for the game. Yes, lies were told, but... there is this not totally terrible game that has resulted from the project which you can play.

But its time to look at the game actually being built, as opposed to pie in the sky bullshit that usually surrounds the game.

Star Citizen is a full loot sandbox game. It has as much in common with Rust as it does with Eve Online. It is perhaps the most promising full loot project currently in development. This is partly because most devs sadly don't touch full loot gaming with a 10 foot pole (devs - and especially the funders of development are cowards), but is also because Star Citizen has some pretty damn impressive tech behind it at this point. Ships in ships, large universe, seamless transitions between planets and now a high population cap.

It looks like Star Citizen is gearing up to be about faction infighting.

**Faction infighting**

Star Ctiizen has a bunch of land vehicles, that appear to be totally useless to the game. They've been in the game for a while, but there's no reason to actually use them. Its  a spaceship game after all, so why use a tank when you can use a Starfighter or gigantic flying gunship to attack an enemy position from the air? Well, it looks like the reason is gonna be shields.

Star Citizen is adding base building, and the key to it seems to be the presence of large dome like shields that protect an area from attack from the air. Some of these shields are even said to be completely invulnerable  - and cannot be broken from the air, so how do you attack anyway? The answer is likely to be the constellation of ground vehicles that have been in the game for years with no real use.

**Base raiding**

Star Citizen is getting bases, and they need giant shields to protect them, so it stands to reason that we're also getting base raiding. Players will be able to explore a planet, and set up bases in various territories on its surface. You can put up your own giant shield which is difficult to break, and do your thing.

If someone wants to attack your base without declaring war by attacking your shield, they'll have to put down vehicles on the surface outside of your shield, and drive them in. This is a really interesting system for building a PVP end game. You invest in a location, pour resources into it, and try to extract as much as you can before another group notices it and decides to destroy it. You can then try to defend it for as long as possible, or just put down another base elsewhere and start over. This process should generate immense wealth over time - especially if you're putting down bases in lucrative low security space and providing your own defense. Its an engine for never-ending fun content. Its Rust, but in space, with Space Ships. Instead of wiping the server, bases get wiped individually. The world of Star Citizen is so large that it should take time for enemy corps to find your bases in the game world, time enough to maybe turn a profit before your sandcastle is kicked over and you have to start again.

**Conclusion**

Everything I wrote is just supposition. Its based in fact. The game does feature ground vehicles, they are adding bases, but the notion that this is intended to be the game's primary PVP content generation loop is  my own personal belief. It IS enough, a loop like that where explorers search for bases, and builders try to mine out resources before they're found, and pirate and rival orgs wage war on existing bases to loot what they can... that's a good god damn loop for a full game. Its the kind of loop that could ensure such a game's success, despite its rocky start and bad reputation.

Most of what is necessary for this loop currently exists in some form. You have transport ships to move goods to and from bases. You have combat ships to wage war over a base. You have ground vehicles to raid them, mining ships to mine the surrounding area, scanning ships to find such bases and resources that indicate that a base should be placed down.

All that's really missing are the bases themselves.

CIG tries to sell the game as everything to everyone, but I think that's stupid. What they're planning in the short term is pretty damn good. I think they should lean into what they intend to actually deliver in the near term, because I think that what they intend to deliver sounds better than the vague ""simulation"" bullshit that is usually marketed. Its why despite the scam-y nature of its development, I still keep an eye on the game.

They're getting close to something really impressive - maybe.",True

1obbwix,why dont more free 2 play games have level progression mechanics?,1760938879.0,0,0,False,"best examples: COD Warzone/COD Mobile , Splitgate 2, Destiny 2

while i appreciate games such as Fortnite, Apex Legends, and Marvel Rivals, i just cant play them for long without that dreaded feeling of ""this is fun and all, but what really is the point of playing this, other than fun?"" because thats honestly really what i feel the sole purpose of those games are, and nothing else. youre probably gonna say ""well no shit, thats what video games are primarily created for"". and youre 1000% correct! however, its also totally reasonable to want just a little more from video games, which is why there are hundreds of genres,sub genres, and overall thousands of games to choose from anyway.

but going back to the topic at hand, and the games in question, what completely negative reasons are there for having level progression in said games, if there are any? in Fortnite and Apex legends, why arent we able to level our guns up and unlock attachments, like in Warzone and Splitgate 2? or why not add a seperate game mode for this? in Marvel Rivals, unless im 100% incorrect(since i havent fully played the game since like january), why doesnt each character have their own Level progression(or since its 2025, a character specific ""battle pass"" thats FREE maybe?). where we level up and unlock new skins,or new abilities? something along those lines.

i just personally feel adding such mechanics would really add a lot more (replay) value to the games. and again, the examples of Warzone and SG2 were used because those games are completely free 2 play AND include the mechanics in question, and it WORKS great. im able to play those games, work on leveling up my guns, unlock camos for those guns, unlock calling cards, emblems, etc. i just wish more games had such mechanics. instead, at the end of the day, they really just serve the purpose of entertainment, and entertainment only, and it really makes me feel they could be so much more than that. its like the only way to get anything close to what WZ and SG2 does, is via a battlepass

1ob9ri7,Star Citizen and the weenie problem.,1760931894.0,0,0,False,"  
  
Star Citizen as a project has a lot of issues, and everyone knows about the ones involving development. 

But there are deeper problems with CIG's forever project. Frankly, its userbase. 

It doesn't understand what kind of game CIG is making. 

Star Citizen is a full loot game. You can shoot other players, and take their stuff. You can shoot up their ships, and take their stuff. It hails from a long line of masterpieces, from Ultima Online to Rust to Eve Online and Albion. This type of game is popular, and the formula works. 

But CIG didn't tell their backers that this is what they're doing. 

So people have been backing Star Citizen for over a decade now, without really understanding what kind of game they're backing. 

Star Citizen has more in common with Rust than tranditional MMORPGs. The game that it most closely resembles is either Albion Online or Eve Online, but the people that bought Eve and Albion understood what they were getting into, and for the most part, the Star Citizen userbase doesn't. 

They genuinely believe that they're supposed to be playing some kind of Destiny in Space rather than Rust in Space. They think they're getting a themepark on rails when they're really getting a survival sandbox.

And this is problematic. 

First its problematic because CIG should have been more upfront with them than they were. CIG has a long track record of trying to be all things to all people, and they want to sell ships, so they've been playing down the anti-social aspects of their game. They haven't been as up front about it as they should have been. Star Citizen is designed to allow other players to take your shit. Its designed to have them find you, blow you ship up, and take your hard earned loot. These people, are understandably upset. 

And its also problematic because these people are trying to ruin the game. 

Because Star Citizen would be the best game it can be as a full loot survival MMO. CIG has a good vision for the game. Bases and base raids, with land vehicles and shields, fleet battles... all that makes sense in a full loot environment. Full loot makes the battles matter, keeps things high stakes, adds to the game's tension. It injects thrill into the game when you successfully haul your goods getting past that gank squad. It gives you a reason to improve as a pilot, so that you can enjoy the spoils of victory. It is good for the game.   
  
But the community does not believe this. The community is in denial about there being a long history of successful full loot games, from Rust to Albion. It continually fights to ""weeniefy"" Star Citizen.  

And the game has enough problems, god knows the game has enough problems, without a large contingent of its fans looking to pull a ""New World"" and have the game dump its original vision midway through development. 

I feel for Star Citizen's weenies. I get that Star Citizen's true nature wasn't explained well enough to them. It was explained, CIG has from the start said that Star Citizen would feature piracy... but I think that CIG kind of let people go on thinking that it was going to be whatever the fans wanted it to be... and that isn't right when you're talking about a full loot game. 

So while I have sympathy, I also hope that the weenies don't get their way. They will ruin Star Citizen as New World was ruined. And we all know the project doesn't need any more monumental challenges. ",True

The enemy design, the way they design audio, the way this game can be at times goofy and at times TERRIFYING.

I mentioned akuma kira's audio design is very characteristic to me and I MEAN IT, less than 30 minutes in the game and I already felt a strong memory pull from spooky's.

The OST is very nice personally, sometimes it gives you a peaceful and nice sound, and sometimes it'll give you ambience so heavy you'll remember this eldritch creature named akuma kira is firstly and mainly a horror game dev.

And yes, even tho this is an rpg with action and magic and shit, it still managed to freak me out sometimes with sound effects, enemy placement (or complete absence of enemies which gives agonizing anticipation) and the recurring tendency of certain areas being dark as shit.

It's Lee Petty's best work yet. It's a scape of environments, concepts, feelings, meaning, sound, that you traverse organically. There is no HUD, there is no score, there is no combat, there is nothing that can detract from the lush, richly imagined world that you wander through guided by mere curiosity and wonder.

Visually, it looks like the sort of beautiful game concept art you may have seen long before a game release usually looking nothing like the final product, even if the final product is beautiful.l, because a game cannot hope to match it. In Keeper's case, it's like the concept art came to life and *is* the product. This game, and I am not exaggerating, is like a painting almost every single frame of the way. I can't even name you a game that is this beautiful in terms of flawless execution on art direction. You'll come across very many exquisite shots that are sublime compositions. Anu of which you can just take a still of and hang on a wall in your house. Nothing is jarring, out of place, ugly or aesthetically weird looking.

It's filled to the brim with a very rich palette of colors that is such a feast to the eye you might start suspecting you spontaneously contracted tetrachromacy. Its painterly quality reminded me of one of my favorite movies ""What Dreams May Come"".. there are many moments in the game where you could swear you're looking at actual paint in a subtle yet visceral way I've not seen in any other game, even ones that are supremely artful like Shadow of The Colossus or Journey, nor ganes thst introduced actual brush strokes like Okami.

The sound design is special in that the sound is masterfully interwoven with its evolving beauty. You just have to experience it to feel it. A lot of the time the music is in the soundscape mixed in with the pace at which you do things, ambient sounds and other sound FX mixed into it all. There is just a rhythm and cadence to the game that underscores everything where it can be seen almost like a musical composition. It's hard to put into words, but it's very clear great effort went into creating a world where the player naturally explores and discovers, while beautifully conducting along the way.

Keeper is an interactive reel of stunning continuous shots that feel endless as you explore curious puzzles and an ever-branching environment. You'll go through awe, disappointment, curiosity, surprise, sheer delight and joy as you let this game take you on a journey through its living and breathing art.",False

Baldur’s Gate 3 - it redefined choice-based storytelling. Players still talk about decisions that changed their entire experience.

Elden Ring - technically older, but its open world and mystery will keep it legendary for decades.

Helldivers 2 - one of the most community driven, chaotic, and fun co op shooters ever made.

Each one gave players something rare, full freedom, community chaos, or story depth that actually sticks. But maybe the real future classic is something no one expects yet.

Especially since the game is ALL on the disc, besides patches, which, on PS5 (they may on Xbox too, I don't know), you can play games without updates.

I wrote an entire post on the BF6 sub on how there's really no excuse for campaign, some aspects of MP, like custom games with bots, and portal to be online only.

1o89ur5,Playing fewer games made me appreciate them more,1760629923.0,77,0,False,"**TLDR**. By playing fewer games, I actually enjoy them more and find it easier to pick something I genuinely want to play instead of feeling bored by abundance.

Has anyone had a similar experience and how did you approach it? I hope these kind of posts are allowed here.

So, full story: I tend to wait at least 1 year before picking up newer titles (for the benefit of fixed bugs, lower prices, and stabler impressions). Still, **choosing what to play became increasingly hard for me lately, and when I started a game, I’d lose interest quickly**. What bothered me most: 1) Everything felt derivative. I felt I've played similar things before. The market felt increasingly oversaturated (here I don't just mean new titles). 2) I felt too many games don’t respect the player’s time. You wouldn’t design software with 80s usability. So no need for games to lack basic QoL or put up pointless restrictions.

What I did: I first stopped playing for a week or two to reset. Then I decided to cut my playtime roughly in half, from 12-16 hours/week to 4-8 hours/week. Over a few weeks, I settled into a new routine:

* Deleted my backlog (and won’t make a new one). I just play something if I really feel like it. No FOMO.
* Play only top rated games in genres I enjoy (both indie and AAA). I've limited my time, so I can't afford FOMO about mediocre titles (which still shine in their moments, of course).
* Skip any game that wastes time, for example with poor QoL or filler content.
* Give new games a fair chance, but if I’m not having real fun after an hour or two, I drop them.

During this I found that I was actually excited to play games again. So my time feels better spent overall. What I do with the extra time: go to the gym more & do more cardio, read more books, and watch more shows and movies.

Now that I’ve written it out, it seems painfully obvious. My main mistake was probably thinking that boredom with one game meant I needed to find another. Usually, I just needed a short break. Unless you’re deep into competitive gaming, it makes sense that playing constantly makes even good games feel repetitive. 

I guess pacing myself or taking breaks keeps a hobby fun. Unfortunately, that ""filthy casual / skill issue"" mindset makes it hard or impossible to get into certain genres (for example, I finished BB and DS3 for the first time during Covid when I had much more time, I guess I couldn't get into them today). But the alternative is losing motivation due to burnout, which is worse.",True

I wrote this (added/edit: as an opinion piece on a blog) in Dec 2023 when the game first came out, and I decided to just post the whole thing here directly as I don't wanna mess with getting in trouble with self-promotion or link sharing, and I wanna share it because I think the game just deserves to be played by more people, because it's great and it's now on a big sale on Xbox ($18) and also on PS Plus:

Alan Wake wasn’t just one of the best games to release on Xbox 360, it was one of the best games of the entire generation. 13 years later, I still can’t believe a sequel is here, and after completing the game, I’m asking myself if this will be thought of in the same way. I loved the first Alan Wake a lot. Like, a whole lot. In the middle of my Alan Wake 2 playthrough I jumped into the backwards compatible version on Xbox Series X and loaded into one of my old saves – and I’ll be damned if it doesn’t still look and feel great. I love that it has this great horror theme without strictly being a horror itself, and I love that the combat and gameplay keeps things super tense without being overly scary. I love horror, but I love that Alan Wake was a more accessible type of horror story, especially for those who usually keep away from the scary stuff. Alan Wake 2 is a very different game to Alan Wake. The sequel makes a full shift to survival horror, leaving behind many of the reasons I liked the first game so much, but I really love that Remedy was confident enough to not just update an old formula, but completely evolve everything about Alan Wake with the sequel.

There are a few things about the gameplay systems that I don’t love, but I’ll get back to that in a bit. Remedy games are anything but average, and Alan Wake 2’s story and setting is an ambitious continuation of the first game, with the time between the first and second game being the same real time that’s passed between the release of the first game and its sequel.

What really makes things exciting – and I’m not going to say much about this – is that since CONTROL, we now know that some Remedy games may share a connected universe, and the way they’re going about it feels very smart and restrained – unlike, you know, the way some other people handle this sort of thing. Alan Wake, the tortured writer who’s been trapped in the dark place for 13 years, now shares the limelight and torchlight with a second protagonist, Saga Anderson, an FBI agent who travels to Bright Falls with her partner that looks a whole lot like Max Payne – not that one, and for intellectual property reasons, not this one either – to investigate a series of murders. As you might expect, things start going a little “Stephen-King-y” pretty quick, with the bigger story then unfolding over the 20-30 hour campaign.

Something pretty neat is that in many of the Resident-Evil-esque saferooms, you can use a, well… bucket, to swap between Alan and Saga to progress their stories as they spiral towards the conclusion. With Saga in the forests and familiar surroundings of Bright Falls and Alan in the “dark place”, represented as a twisted version of Alan’s perception of New York, it’s a nice literal change of scenery when you swap between them. Saga is also leading in investigation which she manages in her “mind place”, and I loved the aspects of working through case files, linking evidence and discoveries or profiling characters – detective stuff is my jam. Alan, on the other hand, uses a really nifty mechanic where he changes the story of his book to alter his surroundings and open up new scenarios and paths. I really loved just how seamless and creative it all was. Interestingly enough, the game that kept coming to mind the most while playing Alan Wake 2 was actually The Evil Within 2, the survival horror from the same studio responsible for other horrific terrors such as, err… Hi-Fi Rush.

The move to survival horror means that Alan Wake 2 loses many of the elements that I really loved from the first game, like burning away words with your flashlight, a bigger focus on skedaddling from one light to the next and a focus on tension over scares, exchanging them for a more traditional horror game setup, including inventory management, save rooms and over-the-shoulder gun combat. Also, make no mistake, Alan Wake 2 can be scary as balls sometimes, and environments that look like they come out of Silent Hill don’t help either. That said, some of the jump scare tactics are a little cheap and overused. The combat itself is clunky and frustrating at times. I’d jumped back into the Resident Evil 7 Remake again just before playing Alan Wake 2 and also played the Dead Space Remake earlier in the year, and despite being such a similar combat system, Alan Wake 2 easily takes third place where combat is concerned. Since we’ve lost the slow-motion and tension aspects of Alan Wake 1, I often found it very tricky to keep track of enemies, but in a frustrating way, not a scary or challenging way. Inventory management could also be better and didn’t really feel like it added too much to the experience.

The world is filled with discoverable stashes or puzzles that range from looking around the environment to doing some pretty gnarly maths problems. What I really love is that you’re often just left to deal with it – no annoying hints being blurted out by your character. It sometimes left me frustrated that I couldn’t figure them out, and I even missed out on having some good gear for longer than necessary – but I liked that it respected me as a player, and let it be my problem. Google is just a few phone taps away anyways, right? On that note, pacing could be better too, as I often found myself sort of just wombling around for long periods of time – and even with the world being semi-open for you to explore, I was never quite sure if I should go exploring down a side path or if the area I see on the map is an area I might need to visit as a part of the main story later.

Alan Wake 2 is still a fun game to play, although it feels clear that the storytelling came first for Remedy, and while I think that means that Alan Wake 2’s core gameplay could have been even better, I can really respect the focus on what they felt was the most important aspects of the experience. What really helps to support the great story and discoveries, is that following on from the high standards set by CONTROL, Alan Wake 2 has some of the best graphics I’ve ever seen running on a console, while the music and soundtrack created for the game is top notch and a big part of the experience itself. I also wanted to note that I really loved that the characters would often make exclamations like that you’d expect from someone in the situation, often mirroring what I was saying and thinking as well. I had the option of a performance mode that targets 60fps or a quality mode that targets 30fps but considering the pace of the game and the importance of the audio/visual aspects, I very happily opted to stick to the quality mode and was happy I did. The image can get noisy at times, but the atmosphere provided by thick fog, dramatic lighting, beautiful reflections and incredibly detailed characters, environments and objects had me in a constant state of awe.

The game jumps between real video footage and video game graphics, and we’re getting so close to real looking visuals that these sorts of jumps are barely even jarring anymore. It was also pretty polished at launch, although I had a few issues with cut or delayed audio a few times.

So, does it deserve to be Game of the Year? The excellent details or little frustrations are almost irrelevant next to the real reason that Alan Wake 2 is so special and why it deserves to be considered as the best Game of the Year. 2023 may be filled with many great games, but how many of them truly delivered an experience that you haven’t already sort of seen or played in some form before. Sure, some gameplay elements may be a little familiar, but Alan Wake 2 is wildly experimental with its storytelling and presentation on top of still delivering a video game that’s wholly engrossing, fun to play and incredibly good to look at. As a sequel to Alan Wake, it’s a bold shift in genre and story that’s usually only seen in reboots. As a continuation of Remedy’s connected universe, it’s an exciting next step that opens up the door for even more mystery and discovery. The door has definitely been left wide open. Alan Wake 2 is what it looks like when a team that’s capable, confident and firing on all cylinders puts all their trust and energy into a focused vision by a creator that really seems to know what the hell they are doing. But hey, Alan Wake 2 is just a video game, but it’s also not just a video game at all. It’s the rare combination of technical mastery and artistic vision that furthers our understanding of what video game experiences can be. 

So, does Alan Wake 2 live up to the 13 years of expectations that I built up for myself? Well, no it doesn’t, because I expected to get more of the same, with a few twists and some better graphics. Instead, it was something very different and unexpected that pushed Remedy’s excellent approach to storytelling and immersive experiences to another level… and I can’t see how that isn’t a whole lot better.

Here’s everything I remember:

	
•	It was 3D, third-person, with surprisingly pretty graphics for its time — not realistic, more stylized, kind of “Zelda-pretty.”
	
•	Online, meaning there were other players walking around, but you didn’t really do anything with them. You were just in the same world.
	
•	It was not violent — no swords, no combat, no quests or PvP.
	
•	It had an open world feel — you could explore freely.
	
•	The setting was up in the clouds or high in the mountains, with bridges, floating islands, that sort of vibe.
	
•	You controlled some sort of non-human character — like a small fantasy creature, somewhere between a fairy and a wizard, but not quite either.
	
•	The name was maybe something with “Luna” or “Lunar” in it — but I’m not 100% sure.
	
•	You could see other players wandering around, but there was no fighting or cooperation — just a shared space.

I have ruled out:
	
•	Luna Online, Lunia: Record of Lunia War, Angels Online, Fiesta Online, Flyff, Mabinogi, DOMO, Free Realms, Second Life, There, MapleStory, etc.
None of those match exactly — they’re either too flat/2D, too MMO-like, or too combat-focused.

So yeah — a beautiful 3D online world, probably from the mid-2000s, maybe called something with Luna, where you were a small floating creature exploring mountains and clouds with other people around doing basically nothing.

1o6h1i7,E-Sports Godfather,1760452115.0,0,0,False,"TLDR: The game is an elaborate and well constructed management sim paired with a combination of real-time auto-battles and turn-based deck building.  Each round is like an auto-chess battle, but instead of chess it's an actual MOBA game and you're playing cards to influence the outcome of the match.

===

I opened this game up not expecting much.  It was just a game that I had on my wishlist, went on sale, had good reviews, and was under my purchase threshold.  So I just pulled the trigger on it and went on my way.

As it happens, I was wanting a break from Caves of Lore and spun it up, not really knowing what to expect.  What I found originally baffled me.  The art style in part of the game is pixelated, and in another part of the game it's pretty Korean anime.  The music reminds me of The Sims some of the time, but not while the matches are underway.

But as I played it more (I have about 20 hours in the game now), it struck me that this was like Slay the Spire mixed with a MOBA.  It's more than that, but the parallels are there.  It was no surprise, therefore, when I looked at the game on Steam to have it described as ""deck-building game simulating MOBA e-sports"".

Instead of having runs that unlock stuff for other runs and meta-progression that makes the game easier so you can do harder difficulties in each isolated run, ESG sets the stage with you as the manager of a nascent e-sports team.  After answering a couple of questions about what you think is important for the team to function properly (thanks for that!) they recommend some players to you.  

Your team size is fixed, and each player has a fixed position on the map (top, jungle, mid, bottom, support).  They have potential (eg B, C, S) for both individual stats (eg offense) and roles (eg tank).  They come with a set of characters they can use in matches that fall into those role archetypes, and they usually match their aptitudes pretty well.  As you progress in the game, you'll be able to add new characters to each player, and as they gain experience with them (typically though using them in matches or scrimmages), they gain bonuses to using them and the opportunity to alter how their skills work (eg increasing critical rate vs attack, more power per level).

So at the beginning of the game, they give you some solid options for each, and if you don't like the look of them you can reroll (to a limited extent) to get a new one.  Once you select your players, you do a set of matches against other hopefuls who want to be let into the pro league so you can make money and get fans and have people come to your venue to watch you play matches.

So that's the management ""metagame"", I guess.  But what about the actual game?  The bread and butter of it is MOBA combat, with your players controlling lanes and bringing down towers and vying for control of the map.  Every so often, you and your opponent will accumulate strategy points, which takes you from autobattler to ""let's gank those guys"".  Each player has cards they can play, as well as each character.  And that combination between all of the players is your draw deck.  As you get strategy points, you'll draw cards, and when you get to 8 points you get the opportunity to use them.  One of the assassin junglers lets you move a few hexes over and start a fight with any nearby enemies.  So if you have a struggle going on in the bottom lane you can turn that tide ... as can your opponent.  Fighting near towers often allows the tower to support the defending team, but not always.

As the match progresses, each character gains money, which directly gives them more power.  And they gain levels.  In later stages of the game, you will unlock the ability to set items that they will use once they meet a monetary threshold.

Every so often during the match (and you can see when it's going to happen), there will be some kind of big fight that characters from both sides will participate in for rewards.  The winners of these fights grow ever more powerful.

You'll be looking for synergies between characters, but there's a fly in that ointment.  For example, in one match I had a character supporting in the bottom lane that could debuff an enemy on strike so that they take additional damage during a fight.  The character in the support role always supports the bottom lane character, and my bottom lane character was one that did splash damage, amplifying the effect of the debuff.  But there's a draft before the match.  You can ban characters.  Your opponent can pick the ones you want if they have them available.  So you need to be flexible, and discovering how you can make things work together is part of the joy of the game.

At first, it was all overwhelming.  But when I came back to it with more understanding of how the game works and plays, I began to see that it's an absolutely brilliant design.

So if you want some MOBA in your card-based roguelite, give it a shot.  Expect to be overwhelmed at first, but pretty soon you'll see how the pieces fit together.  There are a TON of options, including difficulty.  I pretty much just set the difficulty to normal and just accepted the defaults.  They have indicators when you select those options as you start a new game that tell you what to pick when you're a noob.",True

over manipulated over controlling devs are nannys is the vibe I am getting from the released game.

the maps, the boundaries they made to limit gameplay so weirdly, there are stairs you go half way up and an invisible wall stops you, and the stairs dead end 5 feet later and there is no reason to not just let you go that 5 feet farther, like wtf?

the XP challenges seem cooked up by AI, they make no sense, and they limit progression and make the game so grindy, not fun not rewarding to then find after the grind the weapon you unlocked sucks.

my avatar runs over a small rock and makes this weird leap into the air I guess its cinematic, to me its annoying AF, at times its like 'dude please no dont' trying to move as low as possible and character wants to jump around like its a musical theatre production or something.

I want to step up one bit onto a little ledge in front of a low wall to shoot, cant just move onto it I have to jump every so slightly to get into position, nope character grabs wall and leaps over it, cant be stopped its like my character is high on meth or maybe an out of control kitten, same thing.

For the money... I wish I hadn't, and its a close race I could love this game but it is working overtime to be annoying as it can.

making the assault rifles super bad noticeably far worse than sub-machineguns, making a 14"" barrel 5.56 rifle round slower and drop more and far less accurate than a 9mm from a 6"" barrel, FML I paid for this?

1o5xd1y,Did anyone knew they made a competitive format for Elden Ring and it involves a bingo board?,1760392093.0,0,0,False,"I never really consumed Elden Ring content but this thing I'm binging it HARD.

For those who don't know the gist of it is that two (or 2 teams of 2, more on that later) players are given the same 5x5 bingo board full of tasks from the game, the tasks go from ""kill x"", ""kill a remembrance boss with a remembrance weapon"" to ""complete x catacombs"" and ""get x incantations"" etc. Those tasks are very varied and for the most part very clever as some are straightforward and some require a lot of preparation.

The first player to complete a task marks it on the board and blocks the other from completing that task. A player wins if they can either complete a bingo line or marks 13 total tiles.

Now they are on the fifth season and they introduced this very clever way of implementing a 2v2 competition that includes both the base game and the DLC; one player in each team starts in the DLC content and the other in the base game and on the board there are tasks that can only be completed in the base game, tasks that can only be completed in the DLC and tasks that need cooperation (for example kill both Rennala and Rellana).

It's a great game, and I'm really enjoying it, but jesus, it's almost impossible to intuit the majority of enemy attack timings compared to something like the Paper Mario series or other games with timed defense mechanics.

1o5w8iz,Ghost of Yotei. My review.,1760389519.0,0,0,False,"I have bone to pick with Ghost of Yotei. There will be spoilers, want to chew deep into the marrow.

Finished the game with 96% completion rate, took me 49 hours. 

The first 20-25 hours were the best there could be in gaming. It was 10/10 for me at that stage. Then it all fell apart. Slowly at first, but when the credits rolled I was thinking to myself ""I should have bought physical edition so i can resell this…"" Learned my lesson and would probably not buy next Sucker Punch game.

**Lets go to the details.**

Firstly, lets take good things, there are plenty to like and even love about this game. 

Graphic is great, both direction and technicality. Direction is more important for me, and this is very, very well made presentation. Giant field of flowers, snow on the trees, pictuesque landscapes. Little details like shadow from Atsu hat on NPC face in a cutscene. AMAZING. 

Sound is on par, with very good separation of every step, rain drop, footstep and crunchy combat. It was soo good, that to the very end i enjoyed it without any fatigue on my part. Most sudios could learn how to make sound for Sucker Punch. 

Music, when presented, was great. Especially the singing parts when major story beats happened. I may buy soundtrack. 

Combat was great, from the beginning to the end. Despite my Atsu being killing machine, improvising on the fly, using my tools like kunai and switching weapons - there was not a moment of rest in the middle of combat. Enemies are very, very aggressive, will attack you constantly on multiple angles. If you have time to breath its a split second after one attack. There are more coming. To the very end, basic enemies still could surprise me how fast they can attack. It also, hurt. 

Atsu is much, much better written character than Jin. Not that hard, because Jin was not a very noteworthy character. Still, Atsu is good. I both sympathized with her and cheered her along the way. She made me invested in the story. There are also some nuances in Yotei Six. Some of them at least.

**Spesking of story, lets go to bad…** 

Story is Hollywood revenge story. With all cliches. Even worse than that, because main villain is just BadGuys McBadGuy from BadGuyTigerClan. Atsu made me invested, I was caring because she was there. Lord Saito is just… Bland. He is bad guy samurai lord who does bad guy samurai lord things. But not really? Like, he is in oposite of clan Matsumae, who are presented as good guys of some sort... It is all very muddy to be honest, and to the very end i didnt know if non clan people are against Saito/Matsumae clan or with. We work with Matsumae and they are in oposition to Saito so are they good guys? There are quests and hints that Ezo is this wild land than would not bend the knee to Shogun or Saito. 

Because, get this, Matsumae clan is building roads and bridges. And Saito is bad, because he dont like Matsumae, want everyone to be feed and takes women to her army. Generally can make anyone samurai if they prove them. 

To be honest, its not about there being shades of grey in the story. There arent any. Presentation is very black and white - Saito are bad guys, Matsumae are good guys. They even color coded them, Saito red (bad), Matsumae blue (good). Just there are those bits that dont go anywhere. 

Are people trying to revolt against to Shogun, and by proxy Matsumae? No. 

Are tey joining Saito side beause he is enemy of the Shogun? Also no. 

Just, nothing matters. There is no meat, just leftovers on bone. Does not help that most enemies are named like Saito Bandit.

Lets talk about Saito. He is bland and could be replaced by any other character. If chatGPT was ordered to create standard evil samurai lord, he would create Lord Saito. Hes goons are more interesting than him. Oni is more threatening, more nuanced, more present in the story than Saito.

But, the most criminal thing about this game is pacing. Both story and mechanics. 

I have never, in all my years, seen so poorly paced game. If people very angry that Spider Man 2 3rd act was rushed then o boy! Chapter 3 in Ghost of Yotei took me, and i kid you not, less than hour. WTF?! Its like they make 60% of game and then lost all funds and time. Most the things are rushed, we learn about Saito from some stupid letters. From text! We learn more about Oni and Kitsune, and Spider has more going for him than Saito (to be fair, Dragon is just a goon that we kill, nothing more than Big Named Enemy!). 

See that map, will all thar big, empty space on the right side of the Isle? No, never go there. THE ENTIRE RIGHT SIDE OF THE ISLE IS WASTED SPACE. To the very end i was fooling myself than there will be some unlocked new region. After all, story wise we are at darkest hour. Saito won. Matsumae are annihilated. Their province is in ruin, their castle burned to the ground. Jubei and Oyuki are captured or dead and Atsu is on the run. We killed Dragon in the battle, but Spider and Saito run away. 

Chapter 3 roll in. 

… 

We fight Spider, we go to super secret base to rescue Jubei and Oyuki, we kill Saito under the tree. 

Less. 

Than. 

Hour.

Pacing of mechanics is also bad. I went to the Kitsune second. You learn eagle vision from her, just after you needed it. Because you just infiltrated ninjas stronghold. And you learn that AFTER THAT. Use it maybe 2 or 3 Times when story demanded it. Was worthless. But was this BIG MOMENT in the story. 

Speaking of that, this was where the first cracks showed for me. Namely, Oyuki. After ""revelation"" she is former Kitsune. Eh. This is also where story went full hoolywood and Atsu learned to let go of revenge because its BAD. Because it is NO NO. She has one relapse with Dragon but eh. Atsu went for deep, flawed, human to hoolywood revenge story cliche protagonist. 

Member that rifle and pistol in the trailers? lol, sucker. You unlock them in last zone where there is like 5h of game left, including side content. 

Member promo of Hunting Yotei Six? lol, sucker. You kill one in tutorial, then spend 80% of game hunting Oni and Kitsune, then is last zone. First mission, Dragon escapes. Second mission, Spider is captured. Third mission, Dragon is killed and Spider escapes. 

THATS IT. 

You literally hunt 2 of Yotei Six. 2!. Because rest is served to you on the plater. To be honest, Oni was amazing, so was Kitsune and their zone. Hel, if only rest of the game could be this good.

I like ACS for a couple of reasons. Thought they did a great job. Some things were (in typical ubisoft fashion) a little .....sigh-inducing ... other things were very nice ...

Its familiar und good ... much like GoT and even better in some aspects. World is better. It just seems like a nice evolution from GoT. Having a good swordfight were every parry connects and you rip through your enemies never gets old.

1o5de6z,The Game Awards could actually be really cool if they made awards that were more specific to gaming,1760341250.0,1096,0,False,"Of course, game of the year - just like best picture at the Oscars - will always be the big one.

Gaming (on the surface) doesn't have an equivalent to those so it feels like only game of the year is of any real interest to anyone and then the rest of the awards are equivalent to all the Oscars' various technical categories.

However, each year gaming *does* offer up similarly interesting things if you look at the industry from the perspective of players. Things like best playable character, best new character or best villain would, I feel, drum up a lot more attention and interest than stuff like best sports/racing game. Also, something like best new world with the contenders being literally the name of the city / planet / galaxy a game is set in instead of the name of the game, or something like best single level / stage - or even more specific, best side-quest - would, to me at least, be something pretty intriguing and add more personality to proceedings.

1o449fw,Playing expedition 33 after FFXVI is both exhilarating and depressing,1760210407.0,0,0,False,"I've been a FF fan since FF4 and the FF6-10 are still the best games I've played. Ever since then I have been looking for the same experience in subsequent FF games as well as other RPGs, but never found it. 

FF13 was really bad to me, 15 gave me some hope, an 16 just killed all the hope. What makes 16 really bad for me, is the fact that it's another souless commercial product, with no innovation, creativity and most importantly, zero passion. I believe what made classic FFs so good, is that they were passion projects. They made bold choices in their stories. They carefully crafted the world. They put emotions into character designs, the music, graphics, the little details. Through playing the game you could feel the emotion the developers were trying to convey to you...because they treat the game as a work of art. Like musicians, they don't simply make products that sell. They make what they believe to be beautiful.

 After FF16, I started to think maybe it's just nostalgia all along, and I will never find that feeling again when I first experienced the world of classic FFs for the first time. That was until I picked up Expedition 33, right after I finished FFXVI, and completely unintentionally as I saw the game being sold at the local gaming shop.

E33 is everything I thought was missing in FF16. Gameplay wise I’m actually not a fan of turn based system, but in other aspects E33 really recreate the FF magic: explorations actually give great rewards (not bloody hides in FF16), a party system that let you experience with a wide variety of builds, a variety of enemies, no mindless fetch quests...

But what makes E33 so reminiscent of classic FFs, is the fact that it's full of passion and clearly made by people who like video games and want to make great games, regardless of whether it sells well or not. The world is beautifully crafted, both design wise and graphics wise. The settings is interesting, with very memorable characters that feel like they can be real people. The stories and its plot twists are bold, because they're certainly controversial but the writers decide to go with that direction anyway. The result is a very unique story I have never seen in any video game. In contrast, FF16 is super safe. Nothing in its story really surprises you. Square tried to make everything as ""undislikeable"" as possible which in turns make it extremely boring.

I appreciate the amount of care and effort Sandfall put into E33. Every area is carefully crafted. Each is beautiful and unique, and that really makes you feel like exploring. Some songs are only played like twice the whole game, and yet they were of superb quality.

I just want to thank Sandfall for letting me feel like 13 year old kid playing through classic FF games again, an experience that I thought was just pure nostalgia. As for FF games, I don't think square can ever make a great FF game again, because it's now a corporate selling commercial products.

1o3wcgr,Game categories or tags(steam) need to mean something again.,1760191157.0,16,0,False,"I know my title might make me sound like old man yells at cloud, but hear me out. So many game genres and categories are a more specific version of an existing game genre. This is good. If you are looking for a specific genre, you can go in the specific category, and if not, then the broad one.

My issue is that most ""specific genres"" have slowly been given the role of their broad parent. Which means now you have 2 categories that fulfill the same role, and have to sort through a bunch of unrelated stuff to find the games in the specific genre. There's other similar offenders too that share their ""new definition"" with a brother rather than a parent. I'll give examples in a bit. Many of the offenders can be given the excuse ""well this game is a \[genre\] game"" and be technically correct because of the meaning of the words, but incorrect in the spirit of the genre. It's like saying a movie is an action movie because the characters perform actions is what I mean.

Here are some examples of this happening. We have tons of strategy games. We have subgenres to group strategy games that share features. One of these that was used for years was ""Tactics"" named after final fantasy tactics and groups game akin to it like fire emblem. It worked fine as a genre/descriptor for like a decade. Tactics the word means strategies, now 90% of strategy games are also in tactics categories.

I'm not going to bore you with a paragraph for each genre, but here are some of the ones I've seen:  
Strategy games with tactics tag  
top down shooters with 3rd person shooter tag  
4x games with turn based RPG tag  
tower defense with tactics tag  
tower defense with city builder tag (this applies sometimes, but rarely)  
4x games with city builder tag

1o3slho,Digital libraries and games - does it affect how you feel about games?

Must be an age or generation thing, perhaps.

As many will recongnise, we've loaded up on games over the years with the various ultra deep sales and discounts on steam (or adding monthly games on ps+ whatever).

And it all feels very immaterial, fleeting bits on a disk/ssd somewhere. Like you don't really have games, but you do, and it's an overwhelming netflix type scroll fest. It all just blends together.

I wish I hadn't done this, but I also can't start over as there's games in there that I want to keep. But sometimes I wonder if a fresh account with 15 games or so (good ones) wouldn't give me more satisfaction and pleasure in gaming.

It's probably also linked to ageing out of gaming, and stuff being less impressive than before to a teenagers mind. I get that, this discussion has been had many times. Also games turning into endless grindfests (my favourite genre has been fps, but haven't found a good fps in ages and I'm not into CoD)

Anyway, the point I was going to make. I'm thinking of getting some official box art for every digital game I have, and have them printed somewhere and put into a little phyiscal binder or something. I feel like having a physical thing I can peruse will really allow me to reflect or think about a game while I go throught them like this, instead of scrolling fast through a library. It could peak my interest or hold my attenion more. Also it will make me realise how uselessy big and dumb my library is (by having a physical representation of it) and make me stop FOMO buying games in the steam sales.

That said I've been better with that the last few years. Less interested in 'having games', or FOMO, or time and energy to play a lot. So I usually let the steam sales go by and don't bother.

E33 has a really unique story, very good music and the visuals are awesome. But the combat that is such a huge part of the game is not up to par with modern games. The exploration is very limited when you compare it to a real open world experience or even a semi open world rpg.

1o3eo08,I blinked and the next moment there was a roguelite version to every game I thought I knew,1760134306.0,413,0,False,"Starting wondering about this since I read about the upcoming Painkiller roguelite, a series I absolutely loved playing as a kid and that on replaying already feels vaguely rogueliteish. Could be just because of the fast pacing all boomer shooters have. But also more than likely because I played too many FPS roguelites to not have that association bear down on my perception of every other game I now touch.

Of course, there’s the card based kind everyone first thinks of (the most numerous kind) with deckbuilders and more classic card battlers both being thoroughly enroguelified as a genre concept. Going from all the hard hitters that everyone and their sister knows like Slay th Spire and Balatro for one. All the way down to the more curious examples like Inscryption, the upcoming Shroom & Gloom that’s in the same ballpark more or less. To the nichest of the niche stuff like Sheva, that’s more a turn-based fighter masquerading as card based roguelite. And so many more than I can count and no wonder too if that statistic of every 1 in a 3 indie games being published is in fact some kind of roguelite.

That said, I only mention the deckbuilding variety but there’s also the platformers (the second most numerous though arguably more popular kind), shooters (the underdog of the the genre probably), tactics hybrids that Darkest Dungeon started off a whole decade ago, even city builders and RTS like Against the Storm that rely on metaprogression that’s nothing if not roguelite influenced (roguelite adjacent?) And tower defense games too that already have a similar basic loop in their gameplay anyways. Did I mention the tons of twinstick, tactical RPG and other permutations and reformulations?

I’m not asking which genre or game is gonna get roguelite-ified next. I just can’t not notice how it’s a trend to make a -lite version of most every game imaginable.

1o38ynf,For those who are losing interest...,1760121015.0,0,0,False,"I have seen a few posts where some people seem to be losing interest in gaming or being overwhelmed with the amount of choices available to them.

I don't blame them given the economy, job situation, finances being tight, busy lives, and what else that comes your way, it's hard to find the one game you want or the one game to be your forever game or simply finding the time to sit and enjoy a game.

I have a few pieces of advice that mildly helped me, maybe it could help you.

1.) Take a short break. Go do something else that isn't gaming related. You may find yourself wanting to play one very particular game from your backlog.

2.) Accept that you will miss out on some great games. Just accept it. There's way too many games out there now than there ever before. It's okay that you will never get through your backlog or experience all of them. This is nothing to worry about.

3.) Force yourself to play 1 game. Enjoy it. If you're playing Red Read 2, stop thinking about Expedition 33. If you're playing Expedition 33, stop thinking about Red Dead 2. If you're playing Battlefield 6, stop thinking about BO7. If you're playing BO7, stop thinking about BF6. Easy to say, hard to do I know but with practice it can be done. 

4.) Don't overthink it. Have fun and enjoy. We forget the main part about gaming is to enjoy and have fun!


Just as a reference, I am currently playing Red Dead 2 on my PC and Ghost of Yoteii on my PS5 with a bit of BO6 and MWII sprinkled in between. Though I've bought a few games on the steam sale.

TLDR : If you've lost interest or can't decide what to play, it's ok to take a break and accept that you'll never play every game out there. So take a breathe, take a break, and enjoy that one game you want to play and stop thinking about jumping on to other games and getting overwhelmed with the sheer choice out there. It's okay to miss out on games due to a busy lifestyle and only experiencing a handful of games over all of them.",False

* Softcore PVP. You lose the loot you've found in the current match, but not the loot you brought into the match. Pretty much like every non-extraction pvp game out there.
   * Found a gun thats an upgrade? Found the crafting items you need to upgrade your home base? If you die, the other person can take it. If you survive and make it to extraction, its yours forever, or until the season resets.
   * You get to keep your weapons and armor going into the next match.
   * There's thrill in finding something new and trying to get out with it, the stakes don't have to be 100%.
* Exploration and scavenging aspects. Picking through ruins. Opening drawers and rooting around inside to find items, be they crafting parts or actual equipment
* Realistic weapons and ballistics
   * I like the realism of treating wounds. If one of us gets shot, the priority should become treating the wound so we don't bleed out.
   * If I shoot a bullet, it shouldn't drop into the ground or turn into a nerf dart after it travels 20 feet.
* Weapon customization
   * Forward grips, scopes, lasers, etc.
   * Magazine management is a huge plus
* Tactical combat where its more about caution than it is about running in wildly
   * Less Call of Duty, more Escape from Tarkov.
* Multiplayer 
   * PVP would be preferred, but PVE is also nice. Just something that introduces actors into the equation who aren't predictable bots.

A few aspects I'm not looking for:

* Full loot PVP 
* Arcade shooters
   * I enjoy inertia, slower movement, a more methodical pace, rather than the fast run and gun style gameplay like you'd see in Call of Duty or Battlefield.
* Bullet Sponges (biggest reason I'm not just playing TD2 and hanging in the Dark Zone).
   * If I dump a full mag into your unprotected face, you should not still be coming at me.
* Third Person Shooters

A few aspects I'm neutral towards

* Setting.
   * I prefer modern tactical shooters, but its not a dealbreaker. Historic or retro are also welcome.
* Seasons/Wipes
   * As long as its not incredibly grindy, I don't mind starting over every couple of months.
* Top down shooters
   * Much as I'd love this in an FPS, I'm not averse to isometric gameplay!

1o2dkmx,A Missed Opportunity: How Dragon's Dogma failed to understand its players,1760034002.0,270,0,False,"When Demon's Souls came out of nowhere and became a huge cult hit in 2009, **From Software correctly identified the formula to satisfy it's playerbase**: **""They want to fight lots of scary and challenging things in lots of atmospheric places.""**  
  
And so, a larger, connected world filled with a greater variety of enemies, weapons and builds became the top priorities for the sequel. Dark Souls delivered on this in 2011 and started a train that hasn't slowed down since. **Each subsequent game and spiritual successor, from the more grounded Dark Souls 2 to the frenetic Bloodborne to the massive Elden Ring, provided players with that same solid core** **of ""fighting lots of scary and challenging things in lots of atmospheric places,"" regardless of what other mechanics or variations were made to the formula.**  
  
Meanwhile, in 2012, Capcom released Dragon's Dogma, an open-world ARPG from the Devil May Cry team and its director, Hideaki Itsuno. **It was, at its core, a game about flashy battles with unique character classes against huge and powerful monsters.** The combat was phenomenal, but the world felt empty, the story was lackluster (until the twists start dropping, but it takes a long time to get there), and the enemy variety was small for such a large and lengthy game. It sold decently, but not enough to justify a sequel in Capcom's eyes.   
  
**The follow-up expansion, Dark Arisen, was directed by Kento Kinoshita and seemed to have a solid understanding of what the fanbase wanted**: **More monsters, more abilities and a cool new setting. It delivered** **on all three, opting for a minimalistic story to conserve resources for what truly mattered.**  
  
Finally, we arrive at Dragon's Dogma 2. A sequel directed by Itsuno, released over a decade after the original, that **makes every mistake the first game made and then some**. The enemy variety is miniscule. The world is vast, but empty. The main quest features an abundance of stealth missions in service of a story that completely falls apart halfway through. There's a setpiece boss ""fight"" against a colossus that doesn't actually fight you and will die if you literally do nothing. There are several unique bosses (4 total) that are only fought once, despite the open world being in desperate need of more boss variety. **The dev team's priorities were totally unfocused, and the core concept of ""flashy battles with unique character classes against huge and powerful monsters"" was clearly a lower priority compared to making an amateur-hour ""Game of Thrones"" style political intrigue storyline that fell completely flat.**

Things like the colossus ""fight"" should have been abandoned the instant it became clear that it couldn't actually work as a traditional fight (I assume for technical reasons). The unique bosses should have had altered, common variants that were placed throughout the open world (Ex. If the devs wanted to preserve the unique Medusa fight, add lesser ""gorgon"" enemies that lack her petrification ability as standard bosses). The complex NPC AI should have been paired back once it became clear that it was straining performance. **All of this stuff is extraneous bullshit that most fans of the original would have traded for more variety in classes and enemies.** 

**I bring this up for two reasons: First, to highlight that Dragon's Dogma still has a ton of potential as a franchise that absolutely should not be abandoned. Second, as a cautionary tale for Capcom itself, which repeated many of DD2's mistakes in Monster Hunter Wilds**, another game that is supposed to be about flashy and challenging fights with cool monsters, but chose to place greater emphasis on it's story (which sucked) and open world/weather system (which killed performance).

If you haven't already, please give Dark Arisen a try. It's a truly great ARPG once you get past the slow start. And Dragon's Dogma 2 can now be modded to have many of the aforementioned issues addressed on PC, so it's a good time to jump into that as well.",True

[But Why Tho?](https://opencritic.com/outlet/722/but-why-tho-) \- [Kyle Foley](https://opencritic.com/critic/8332/kyle-foley) \- 9.5 / 10.0

>*Battlefield 6* is a giant leap forward for the franchise, returning it to the peak of online first-person shooters. There was a ton of love and detail put into every aspect of the game, and it has the potential to dethrone Call of Duty as the king of online shooters.

[Game Rant](https://opencritic.com/outlet/60/game-rant) \- [Dalton Cooper](https://opencritic.com/critic/260/dalton-cooper) \- 9 / 10

>At launch, *Battlefield 6* is a fully-featured FPS that should give genre fans countless hours of entertainment. The single-player campaign may be underwhelming in some respects, but it gets the job done, and the multiplayer is a blast. *Battlefield 6* would already be an easy recommendation based on what's there out of the gate, but it's getting even more content in the near future. EA has an aggressive plan for *Battlefield 6*'s post-launch support, with new maps and modes, including a battle royale, right around the corner. *Battlefield 6* is the most fun you will have with a *Battlefield* game in nearly a decade, and I can't wait to see where it goes from here.

[PSX Brasil](https://opencritic.com/outlet/514/psx-brasil) \- [Marco Aurélio Couto](https://opencritic.com/critic/9629/marco-aur-lio-couto) \- 90 / 100

>Battlefield 6 marks the return of one of the greatest multiplayer franchises to its glory days. With one of the best sound designs in the series, a competent destruction system, extensive customization options, and varied maps, the game delivers intense matches and immersive gameplay. The single-player campaign and some design choices may not please everyone, but they do not compromise the overall quality of this excellent title.

[GamesRadar+](https://opencritic.com/outlet/91/gamesradar-) \- [Joel Franey](https://opencritic.com/critic/3423/joel-franey) \- 4 / 5

>Battlefield 6 offers a carefully-crafted and layered multiplayer that strives to be its least threatening self, with innovation and creativity played down in favor of refining all the proven successes from the military genre. What's there will surprise nobody, but thrives when all those components come together – even if the single player can feel fairly threadbare as part of the package.

[Eurogamer](https://opencritic.com/outlet/114/eurogamer) \- [Rick Lane](https://opencritic.com/critic/767/rick-lane) \- 4 / 5

>Ultimately though, Battlefield 6 clearly understands what makes the series special, even if it occasionally seems reluctant to accept it. Unlike 2042, the fun is easy to find from the outset, and what problems it has are much simpler to fix. It could be more ambitious, and I'd like more of those larger sandboxes to play in, but overall Battlefield 6 is a reliable reset – and, crucially, a very strong foundation for EA to build upon.

>I’ve had such a good time learning the maps, mastering weapons, and discovering quirks of Battlefield 6, and I can’t wait to see how the live-service model rolls out over the next few months. Battlefield 6 is a brilliant time, and one that, for the first time in almost a decade, has a serious chance of rivaling Call of Duty.

[VG247](https://opencritic.com/outlet/549/vg247) \- 4 / 5

>As it is right now, with the quality and quantity of content in the launch package of Battlefield 6, it is incredibly easy to recommend the game to anyone who enjoys multiplayer shooters. It’s an especially exciting proposition for those of us who just cannot keep up with Call of Duty’s rollerskates-based movement and its instantaneous time-to-kill. There’s finally a compelling middle ground between the indecipherability of tactical shooters and the yearly slop of CoD, and it’s one you won’t have to convince yourself to play simply because it’s there, you’ll do it with a big grin on your face because of how fun it is.

[ZTGD](https://opencritic.com/outlet/97/ztgd) \- [Terrence Johnson](https://opencritic.com/critic/8293/terrence-johnson) \- 9 / 10.0

>What can I say, Battlefield 6 feels like a return to form for one of gaming’s most diverse and explosive first-person shooters. The team delivered a gripping campaign full of political intrigue, great characters and enough “only in Battlefield” moments to last us until the next one. But for me, its strongest asset is its multiplayer, low map count aside there are modes here to tickle any shooters fancy. I loved this game so much, in my last match before getting off to write this review I just had the biggest grin on my face as I turn a failed helicopter flight into a parachute landing and a quad kill AND point capture. Only in Battlefield, indeed.

[TheSixthAxis](https://opencritic.com/outlet/68/thesixthaxis) \- [Stefan L](https://opencritic.com/critic/313/stefan-l) \- 8 / 10

>Battlefield 6 is a return to form for the large scale shooter, with a great blend of infantry classes, mechanised warfare, some clever new game modes, and without too much nonsense wrapped around it. It's a true successor to Battlefield 4, right down to the naff campaign.

[IGN](https://opencritic.com/outlet/56/ign) \- [Simon Cardy](https://opencritic.com/critic/5521/simon-cardy) \- 5 / 10.0 (IGN ONLY REVIEWED THE CAMPAIGN HERE)

>At nine missions and just five hours, Battlefield 6’s campaign’s flame doesn’t burn for long, and it doesn’t burn particularly bright in that time, either. It’s a staggering spectacle to behold at times, and a treat for the ears at others, but when it comes to mission design and an engaging plot, it fails to deliver at all. A quick afternoon of fun, it's a safe reimagining of what Battlefield once was, but far from a bold reinvention of what it could, and maybe should, be now.

1o1xdef,Xbox controllers are likely a scam. What's the best 3rd party controller?,1759986340.0,0,0,False,"One that will last more than 1 year. I don't want to give them more money.

I've had sticks drift, bumpers broken, rubber stops fallen off, sticks drift, vibration motors stop working, charge ports go loose, audio ports develop static and then stop working, sticks drift, all mics gradually lose sound fidelity (explain mechanically how that even happens), I've even had one start smoking after plugging it in, and did I mention stick drift.

It always starts a little bit at a time, and then it breaks all at once. I've gone through 13+ controllers, and I personally think it's on purpose and a scam, but you be your own judge.

Any single point of failure is uncommon enough that they can get away with it, but together the odds of it breaking make it last about 1/year.

Who do I give my money to, instead.

Update: People acting like the Xbox controller doesn't break every 1-1.5 years are lying through their teeth, or maybe they're only using it on PC.

I've never thrown a controller. Everything that breaks happens from usage.

Charger and audio ports break from the cords being inserted and removed over time. The charge port can break just from the downward weight of a charge cord. Stick drift happens from repeated very fine adjustments like in games with build mechanics, not a dusty environment or eating around a controller, it isn't avoidable despite what people claim. The bumpers can break from pressing at the wrong angle enough times. I treat my controllers fine. I've played on Xbox since 2006.",True
