1oljymr,Edgar Allen Hoe,funny,1761990949.0,3596,0,False,"Once upon a midnight dreary,
I was feelin’ kinda weary,
Quoth the mirror, “Boy, you scary—
But damn, you could be fine.”
I’ve written odes to death and sorrow,
Dreamt no joy for each tomorrow,
Then I thought, “Why beg or borrow,
When I could sip this wine?”

Nevermore, I’ll cry in vain,
Nevermore, I’ll wear my pain—
Got lace and lust, not guilt or shame,
Call me Edgar Allan Hoe.
From crypt to club, I make it known,
My heart’s as black as onyx stone,
But tonight, I sin alone—
Yeah, I’m Edgar Allan Hoe.


Lenore said love was fleeting,
But my thirst needs constant feeding,
Now I’m ghostin’, never pleading,
Just vibin’ with the moon.
My quill drips ink and temptation,
Dark rhymes, divine flirtation,
A freak in poetic formation

Desire is my doom.


Hear the ravens on the wire,
Whisper tales of want and fire,
“Poe,” they croak, “you’ve gone entire—
From goth to gigolo.”
I just smirk beneath my cloak,
Light my candle, let it smoke,
In decadence I’m newly woke—
A cursed romantic pro.


Nevermore, I’ll grieve the dead,
I’ll kiss the living lips instead,
My soul’s still dark, but my bed’s well-fed,
Call me Edgar Allan Hoe.
Roses wilt and hearts decay,
But I’m still serving night and day,
In lace and sin, I’ll fade away—
Forever Edgar Allan Hoe.

A Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts. However, during analysis it was noted there was a lack of paint on the bird's beaks and claws suggesting that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with motorbikes, while only 2% were killed by cars.

The RCMP then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of motorbike kills versus car kills. The Ornithological Behaviourist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger.

Their high metabolism and constant feeding keep food moving through a short digestive tract, where nutrients are absorbed rapidly. A large cecum—a specialized pouch containing diverse microbes—helps break down plant material but also generates a high volume of fibrous waste. Combined, these traits allow mice to process and eliminate food within hours. So if you ever suspect you’ve got a few visitors, you’ll know soon enough—just follow the brown brick road😉

1ottbiy,About future Bon Appétit/Condé Nast AMAs on r/Food,food,1762816533.0,0,0,False,"Recently, r/Food hosted two AMAs with guests from Bon Appétit. Engagement on the second AMA was very low. In looking at this, we also have to acknowledge prior and ongoing issues at Condé Nast/Bon Appétit, including the recent firing of a trans staff member and union organiser. If we continued to run BA AMAs, it’s clear that these concerns would understandably become a major focus for questions.

Our AMA policy has a core value of “Championing Diversity, Inclusion, and Uplifting/Amplifying Voices,” with a specific focus on women, BIPOC, LGBT, and other marginalised people whose voices aren’t always heard in food spaces. Who we choose to feature as guests needs to reflect this policy.

At this time, Bon Appétit/Condé Nast have confirmed to us that they are not in a position to address these new concerns directly in an AMA format. Continuing to run BA AMAs under those conditions would feel inconsistent with our stated values and with what we expect from guests we host here.

For that reason, we will not be scheduling further Bon Appétit AMAs on r/Food for the foreseeable future. We appreciate the guests who have already joined us, and we also stand in solidarity with marginalised staff and creators in food media who are affected by these decisions.

Going forward, we’ll continue to use our AMA slots for guests who are ready to engage openly with your questions and who clearly align with our AMA core values around diversity, inclusion, and uplifting underrepresented voices.

The too lazy didn't read of it is that I had broken a tooth when I was a kid, and the replacement had lasted me a good 30+ years, but finally broke, too, so as I was getting it replaced, I was on a soft foods diet.  Now, I have nothing against tofu, per se.  I used to moonlight at an Asian restaurant where I was paid crap, but at least was fed dinner five nights a week.  I never did like it when one Thai guy, a chubby little ball of laughter and happiness who chose the Americanized name of Ninja would make my food because it was always mung bean noodles, peas, mushrooms, some sauces, and tofu.  He would hook me up with extra tofu, which ...I really did appreciate him for it, but I mean, I could feel my soul leaving my body when I would eat it.  And it's not his fault that Buddhists don't believe in souls, but he made mine sad.  Grateful, but sad.

So, when tofu came up as literally the top protein of choice for my current predicament, the answer was an absolute, no possible way, not in a million years, no.  Except when I had forgotten about all that and I got tofu.

Anyhoo, I wasn't able to have like ...steak, or chicken, but I could have the ground versions of it all.  Ground beef was a little too rich for my blood, and ground chicken is absolute garbage except in Dino Nugget form, so, as God works in mysterious ways, my sausage guy at work started offering me free or discounted packs he had made that were too small for retail, so the natural step was to add something cheap and filling: biscuits and gravy.

Just wanted to share a little experiment I did with my peppers I grew this year. It's something I've never tried before and I really had no clue if it was going to work, but I'm happy (and surprised) to say it worked out fantastic. I'm sure this has been done before but I've never heard of it myself and couldn't really find anything online about combining fermentation and salt-curing for peppers.

I put a bunch of fresh peppers in a glass jar (I used Chilhuacle Negro but I'm sure most types work), filled it with salt and let it ferment + dry at the same time for a few weeks, emptying out the accumulated water every few days. When they were about 70% dry and had a clear fermented smell I poured them out, rinsed them lightly in water to get off the salt covering them and then let them air dry. With this method you get both the benefits from dry peppers and fermented peppers. They are salty like an olive is and have a deep umami, smoky, almost tobacco like smell. I was honestly blown away how much they tasted compared to a fresh pepper.

The recipe is somewhat loose regarding vegetable/protein portions; adjust it to fit your own tastes!
Also, the chicken katsu was an afterthought, but ended up being the best version I've ever made!

Recipe:
3 lb chicken breast (or just 3 chicken breasts) divided (Cube 2/3 to go into the curry, the other 1/3 will be for the katsu)
3 medium white onions, coarsely chopped
1 lb baby carrots (or just a mid-sized bag)
2 cans bamboo shoots 
1 lb mushrooms, coarsely chopped
Golden potatoes (I didn't measure this, but I'd say I used about 2 lbs)
2 packs S&B Golden Curry Medium Hot mix
MSG to taste (be VERY sparing with this)
Ponzu Sauce to taste
Black pepper to taste
White pepper to taste
Red Pepper to taste
Salt to taste
Dried turneric to taste
Grated Ginger root to taste
Grated Turmeric to taste
All the garlic

Cube 2/3 of the chicken breast; with the other 1/3, cut the breast in half horizontally and then fillet.
Coat both cubed chicken and filleted chicken with salt, turmeric, black pepper, red pepper, and white pepper and a tiny sprinkle of ms.  Pan sear the cubed chicken with a bit of veg oi and sesame oil; the filleted chicken will go through an egg wash and then dredged in breadcrumbs mixed with the same blend used on the chicken. (in a perfect world I'd have used panko, but I only had generic store bought breadcrumbs since it was an afterthought)  then pan fried.

Meanwhile!
 Chop potatoes and onions and toss into a large pot with the carrots; add water to cover and start to boil; keep the boil going for about 5 minutes then reduce heat to simmer. 
 Next we add the S&B Curry; it's similar to a boullion cube in that it comes in large blocks that are meant to dissolve in water. I grated the blocks from both packages with the fine side of a cheese grater; then I submerged a large fine-mesh strainer into the pot with the vegetables (the goal is to create a space of just water within the pot but which still lets the water flow freely) and whisked the grated curry block into the simmering vegetable pot. During this whole process, I simply seasoned as I went using the spices and herbs listed.

After the curry is incorporated into the veg, I added the bamboo shoots, few splashes of Ponzu (I wanted the salt from the soy but thought the acid from the citrus would help balance the dish...it did!), grated ginger, grated turmeric, and minced garlic. 20 minutes later I added the chicken and mushrooms while the katsu fried.

Finally, I first plated it like the stereotypical Japanese curry we all see in anime etc; then I added the katsu, some coursely chopped cilantro, green onions, and a few lime wedges for more acid. I used jasmine rice because I love its fragrance.

- a lot of veggies

- still dried tagliatelles bought from the store (now with another flavour: citrus+thym)
- this time with ground beef 
- lots of veggies as always (almost everything from the day before, but without chives this time)

1oqejzx,[homemade] cheese bread,food,1762471790.0,15,0,False,"Ingredients
	• 500 g of cassava starch (cassava starch / tapioca starch)

	• 250 g of Paraguayan cheese, cuartirolo or a mix of salted fresh cheese + grated mozzarella cheese (firm and salty). If you use only mozzarella, add a little more salt.

	• 100 g of lard (or 80 g lard + 20 g pork fat if you want the traditional version) at room temperature

	• 2 large eggs

	• 200 ml milk (approx.; adjust according to starch absorption)

	• 1 teaspoon salt (adjust according to the saltiness of the cheese)

	• 1 teaspoon baking powder (optional: for slightly fluffier chips)

Utensils
	• Large bowl
	• Grater
	• Knife and board or processor to join (optional)
	• Baking tray and parchment or silicone paper

⸻

Step by step
	1. Prepare the cheese
Grate the cheese(s) finely. If the cheese has a lot of moisture, you can drain it for a while in a strainer so that it does not moisten the dough too much.


	2. Mix dry
In a large bowl, mix the cassava starch with the salt and baking powder (if using). Make a hole in the center.


	3. Add the butter
Add the cubed butter to the well and begin to integrate it with your fingers or a pastry cutter until the starch is moistened (it looks like coarse sand).


	4. Add cheese and eggs
Add the grated cheese and mix. Lightly beat the eggs and pour half into the mixture; Mix with a spoon or with your hands.


	5. Adjust with milk
Add the milk little by little until the dough comes together. The exact amount depends on the starch and cheese; The dough should be malleable, smooth and barely sticky — not runny. If it was very dry, one more tablespoon of milk; If it is very sticky, sprinkle a little more starch.


	6. Knead gently
Knead for about 1–2 minutes: just enough to integrate everything. It is not necessary to knead a lot because if the starch is too laborious it can harden. Form a homogeneous mass.


	7. Form the chipás
Take portions of approx. 25–30 g and form small balls or donuts (traditionally they are oval or ring type). If the dough sticks, moisten your hands a little with water or sprinkle with starch.


	8. Preheat oven
Preheat the oven to 200°C (392°F). Place parchment paper or lightly butter it on the tray.


	9. Bake
Place the chips on the tray leaving space between them. Bake for 15–20 minutes until golden on top and set. If you want them to be more golden, finish with the grill for 1–2 minutes, making sure they don't burn.


	10. Rest and serve

This is her latest: pillowy sweet potato rolls. The sweet potatoes here act like a tanghzhong, which enriches the dough for extra softness. We wanted to share these photos from the test kitchen when they were in the midst of recipe development over the summer. Our social team couldn’t get enough of them.

Full recipe and helpful tips: [https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/sweet-potato-rolls](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/sweet-potato-rolls)

# Ingredients

1 large sweet potato (about 8 oz.), scrubbed

½ cup (packed; 100 g) light brown sugar

¼ cup whole milk

1 ¼-oz. envelope instant yeast (about 2¼ tsp.)

3 large eggs, divided

½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted, plus more for pan and serving

1 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 2¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt, plus more

3 cups (375 g) bread flour

Vegetable oil (for bowl)

Flaky sea salt (optional)

# Preparation

* Step 1: Cut 2–3 shallow slits along length of **1 large sweet potato (about 8 oz.), scrubbed**. Place in a medium microwave-safe bowl; add ½ cup water. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and microwave until sweet potato is tender, about 15 minutes; drain. (Or, steam sweet potato in a steamer basket set over a pot of simmering water until tender, 20–22 minutes.) Let sit until cool enough to handle. Peel; smash flesh to a coarse purée.
* Step 2: Transfer 1 cup (packed; 235 g) purée to the bowl of a stand mixer. Add **½ cup (packed; 100 g) light brown sugar**, **¼ cup whole milk**, **one ¼-oz. envelope instant yeast (about 2¼ tsp.)**, **2 large eggs**, **½ cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, melted**, and **1 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or 2¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt**; mix with a fork to combine. Add **3 cups (375 g) bread flour**, fit mixer with dough hook, and beat on medium-low speed until a soft, smooth dough forms (it may stick to bottom of bowl but should mostly come away from sides), 12–15 minutes.
* Step 3: Turn dough out onto a surface (unfloured) and shape into a ball. Lightly coat mixer bowl with **vegetable oil**. Return dough to bowl, cover tightly with a plate or plastic wrap, and let sit in a warm, draft-free spot until nearly doubled in size, about 2 hours. (For optimal flavor, let dough rise at room temperature 30 minutes, then chill 12 hours to proof slowly.)
* Step 4: Transfer dough to a clean surface (no need to bring to room temperature if chilled; cold dough is easier to work with). Using a bench scraper or paring knife, cut dough into 20 portions (about 43 g each). Working one at a time, cup your hand over dough and drag across surface, moving your hand in a rapid circular motion, to form dough into a tight ball (rolling into balls on an unfloured, ungreased surface creates friction and helps the shaping process). Brush a 13x9"" baking pan with butter and arrange rolls in pan. Cover with plastic wrap; let sit in a warm, draft-free spot until nearly doubled in size and puffy, about 2 hours. Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 350°. Whisk remaining **1 large egg** and a large pinch of kosher salt in a small bowl to blend. Gently brush tops of rolls with egg. Bake until deep golden brown on top and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a roll registers 190°, 30–35 minutes.
* Step 5: Generously brush hot rolls with melted butter; sprinkle lightly with **flaky sea salt** if desired. Let cool at least 15 minutes before serving.
*  **Do Ahead:** Sweet potato can be puréed 3 days ahead; transfer to an airtight container. Cover and chill. Rolls (without butter and sea salt) can be baked 1 day ahead; store airtight at room temperature. Reheat, loosely covered in foil, in a 325° oven until warmed through, about 10 minutes. Alternatively, freeze rolls up to 1 month ahead. Let cool; wrap pan tightly in plastic, then foil. Thaw, wrapped, in fridge 12 hours. Remove foil and plastic wrap, re-cover loosely with foil, and reheat in a 325° oven until warmed through, about 15 minutes. Generously brush rolls with butter and sprinkle lightly with sea salt if desired.",False

1oob3ca,[homemade] spinach with ricotta quiche,food,1762272243.0,15,0,False,"Preparation time: 30 min + 40 min cooking time

-In a bowl, mix three eggs, 250 grams of ricotta, a pinch of salt, pepper, and grated Parmesan cheese.

-In a pan, cook the spinach with a sauté of garlic, oil, and parsley. The spinach should release almost all its water, so at the end of cooking, increase the heat and stir frequently so it becomes more flavorful. Add salt halfway through cooking.

-In an 18 cm baking pan, roll out the puff pastry and, after cutting the eggplant into 0.5 cm thick strips, arrange them along the edges and bottom. In addition to helping the spinach hold its shape, they will add a firm, sweet flavor to every bite.

-Once the spinach is cooked, mix it with the eggs and ricotta prepared earlier.

-Gently pour the mixture into the puff pastry and cover with more puff pastry.

-Decorate the top as desired.  I use leftover puff pastry, brushing it with extra virgin olive oil for added crunchiness, and I added sunflower seeds to the center and breadcrumbs to the outside.

-Bake at 180 degrees Celsius for 40 minutes. In a convection oven, reduce the temperature to 170 degrees Celsius.

-Once baked, it needs to cool completely to fully appreciate all the flavors and achieve the right consistency, so prepare it ahead of time.

It will easily last three days in the refrigerator.

This year I switched it up a bit and went with Paprika Hendl with galushka based on the recipe from [Tasting History.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMNFERb-7Hw&t=407s)

Overall, I'd give it a...6/10.  The chicken and sauce came out pretty good.  Meat was very tender and flavorful and while I'm not a big fan of dark meat, the chicken thighs worked great.  Sauce seemed a little runny.  But I chock that up to me maybe tempering the sour cream as well as I should have or letting it reduce long enough.  The galushka, on the other hand?  Eh. It was kind of bland, a pain to make, and didn't bring much to the table, so to speak. I get it's basically there to be a simple carb that soaks up sauce and included it for the sake of authenticity. But wasn't really wowed by it.  
  
The real win came the next day though.  Had like, eight leftover chicken thighs and a ton of leftover sauce.  So I cooked about two cups of minute rice in the sauce, cut up the chicken, added some frozen veggies, and made a very servicable and tasty casserole that should last me a few days at least.  Paired it with a little cranberry sauce and it was quite good.  
  
Were I to do this recipe again, think some cayenne and garlic wouldn't go amiss. Might also use smoked paprika to deepen the flavor.  The longish braise and simmer certainly does the meat some good and while the prep is a little labor intensive, would recommend for your Halloween feasts or if you're looking to make something simple that can be stretched.",False

​Amazing Malai Chana Masala recipe! 


​Step 1: Boil Chana & Gravy Base
​Soak the chana dal (split chickpeas). Pressure cook the chana with salt and water (2 whistles).
​Separately, in a tiffin box, boil the gravy ingredients alongside the chana (2-3 whistles): onion, garlic, tomato, soaked cashews, and peanuts. Add a little salt, oil, and water.


​Step 2: Prepare Paste
​Cool the boiled onion and tomato mixture, then blend it into a smooth paste.
​Step 3: Fry the Paste
​Heat oil in a pan. Add 1 tsp cumin (jeera) and a bay leaf. Once they splutter, add the paste and fry until the oil begins to separate.


​Step 4: Add Spices and Curd
​In a bowl, mix 2-3 tbsp curd (dahi) with turmeric powder, red chili powder, chana masala, and kasuri methi.
​Add this spice-curd mixture to the frying paste and cook for another 2-3 minutes.


​Step 5: Finish the Curry
​Add the boiled chana to the masala.
​Add water for your desired gravy consistency and simmer briefly.

Progressing through the game doesn’t require firing a single bullet at another player, except when the system occasionally forces it, just to remind you that someone in design thought cruelty equals depth. From a psychological standpoint, this thing isn’t a shooter, it’s a hunting simulator for sociopaths.

The role play mission says “Humanity vs. Arcs,” but the real predators never got the memo. They don’t care about saving humanity, they care about cornering some poor bastard carrying loot, watching the fear set in, and calling it “content.” To beat bigger Arcs, you need cooperation. But to the sick and twisted, other players are the Arcs, walking, talking loot bags with anxiety disorders.

Here is the funny part, they used to whine about the Arcs being too hard, until they realized humans make easier targets. The devs built a game about surviving alien machines and accidentally made a safari park for people who get off on ruining someone else’s night.

Hope is punk.

Game Key Cards are Nintendo's way to have a retail presence... have a copy of a game that some can trade, lend or sell (instead of having a code in a box).

Nintendo is keeping their games on physical cards, but providing options shouldn't been seen as a negative. 

There is no perfect solution as other handhelds do not use carts. With a Steam Deck, an Xbox Rog Ally X, Legion Go, the only option is digital games with no retail presence. Nintendo has done what it can to appease physical gamers, specifically parents or children buying games at retail stores.

People get worried (which is fair) about Nintendo closing the servers in the future, making VGC worthless, but this is just assumption. It is the same situation as a digital game, and Nintendo has never shut down their servers. To this day you can still download your Wii games from the digital store.

Back when i played on 360 we never had a problem finding games or filling lobbies for different titles. Didn’t need bots or to subject ourselves to tons of cheaters. But now its a problem? When gaming is bigger than ever? I just don’t get it. Unless they purposely make it that way because when i turn off crossplay on my console i magically can’t find a match at all. ",True
1ota5rg,Arc Raiders makes me feel out of touch.,gaming,1762769852.0,5281,0,False,"I bought Arc Raiders as my first extraction game, because I wanted to give the genre a try, and a lot of people have been saying it's arguably the most accessible game in the genre, plus it's been gaining tons of popularity and breaking it's concurrent player records constantly, so I figured this game had to basically be some sort of gaming phenomenon.

But after playing for honestly quite a few hours. I don't really get it? 

I've extracted maybe 40 times total now, and I think I've found literally one one interesting thing the entire time, a weapon blueprint. But it was a blueprint that requires a bunch of high level materials I've yet to even see. So it's basically useless. But then I thought to myself, why would I even waste my time building this weapon when someone is just going to hide around a corner, drop me in 2 seconds, and take it? 

And this ultimately made me realize, I just don't understand the appeal of this gameplay loop. You spend hours searching containers for rubber and metal, etc, and for what exactly? These games feel like when you buy a collectible knowing that if you remove it from its box it loses all its value, so it's better to just keep it on a shelf somewhere and admire its existence. 

I personally don't really get the feeling of ""loot anxiety"" for me it's just like ""oh I died, and lost that gun I wasted materials on, that's kinda lame, guess I'll just use the free crappy gun again.""

Like is that supposed to the appeal? The adrenaline rush youre supposed to get because you might lose something you spent hours crafting? I don't really get it I guess.

1ot6wsz,What would YOU want improved in a Resident Evil 5 remake?,gaming,1762757276.0,0,0,False,"There is one glaring wasted opportunity that, while perhaps a minor detail to some, REALLY rubbed me the wrong way in *R.E. 5* (I say that as someone who liked the game overall and beat it on co-op with a friend in high school). I don't care how people try to justify it with weak arguments like Jill being exhausted and needing rest after her fight with Chris and Sheva.

I don't care that Sheva was the 2nd playable character. I don't care that Jill *""assisted""* by tossing the rocket launcher. I don't care that this game was more about Chris's journey, with Sheva & Jill serving in supporting roles. I don't care about dismissive non-counters like *""People don't play these games for story, it's not that deep!""* (This is objectively false; Numerous players over the years have come to care about *R.E.*'s plot despite it never being high art).

THAT climactic finisher against Albert Wesker should've been fired by Chris and Jill together, ESPECIALLY considering that she was tortured the most by their enemy. Wesker was their former S.T.A.R.S. comrade, who revealed himself as a traitor and tried to murder them multiple times. Jill sacrificed herself to save Chris from being killed by him. Those OG heroes had gone through SO MUCH horror together over the years. Jill getting some long-awaited payback could've been her first step on the long road to recovery and moving forward.

Wesker violated her body as a guinea pig in his heinous experiments. At this point (2009), there were over 13 years of history between Jill, Chris, and Wesker. No disrespect or hate to Sheva, of course, but she'd never faced the guy before. She barely knew him. Thematically, she hadn't earned that big of a moment in my opinion. Her helping Chris finally kill one of the franchise's most iconic recurring villains fundamentally didn't leave as much of an impact on many fans, especially those who'd been waiting to see Jill in a main entry again for a decade.

Capcom and the devs should've had the common sense to know this and let Sheva take a backseat for five seconds to toss the rocket launchers instead. If they ever do remake 5, and they don't remedy this by giving Jill that kill shot alongside Chris, I guarantee that won't go over well. On the list of ways to improve on the original version, THIS is the most obvious no-brainer.

If we expand on this, before getting to the point of Jill making the climactic kill shot alongside Chris, I think the remake should also involve her in some way throughout the final boss battle leading up to that finale as support for the player/players. Ex- While Chris and Sheva fight Wesker on the ground in the volcano, Jill could show up starting at the second phase of the sequence in the helicopter equipped with a Minigun. It would be similar to Leon's helicopter support in *R.E. 4*, albeit with this chopper surviving.

Wesker would curse at his former slave, throwing debris at the chopper since it's too far out of his range to grab. Jill might snap back something to the effect of *""You should've KILLED me when you had the chance years ago! I'm NOT your prisoner anymore! Now, DODGE THIS, motherf\*\*\*er!""* When the transformed Wesker winds up one of his big tendril attacks that puts Chris & Sheva on the defensive to evade damage (or insta-kills), Jill could lay down suppressing fire from above, giving them an opening to move from behind cover.

During this short window, players can shoot back to shave off some of Wesker's health from his weak points while he's distracted by the chopper and throws more debris that forces it to circle back around. This cycle would repeat a few times until he's seemingly defeated after the Minigun's ammo runs out and he falls into the lava. Once the chopper gets close enough for Chris & Sheva to board, Wesker resurfaces and successfully grabs it in one last desperate attack. The scene plays out mostly the same as in the original game from here.

Except, Sheva gets the rocket launchers to Chris and Jill, and the reunited duo have one last brief stare-down with the monster their old adversary has become. I'm not sure what they'd say before pulling the trigger, but it shouldn't be something corny. Ex-*""You want S.T.A.R.S.? WE'LL give you S.T.A.R.S.!""* That line only worked with Nemesis, Jill shouldn't say it again here. It should be something simple, raw and realistic that feels worthy of a finale while expressing Jill's anger. The best idea off the top of my head is for Chris to yell, *""Your time's UP, you son of a b\*tch!!""* Jill has the last word: *""BURN- IN- HELL!!!""* Then, BOOM.

Goodbye and good riddance to Albert Wesker. As they fly off into the sunset, the panting Sheva thanks Jill for not using the rockets first. It would've been difficult for her & Chris to avoid getting caught in the explosions while they were down there. Jill replies, *""You're welcome...""*, humorously adding that the Minigun just made more sense for the opening act. Wesker was moving too fast back then for her to get a clean shot with the rockets. She couldn't risk wasting one in case they needed something big to finish him. Chris chuckles, complimenting Jill's judgment for being as sharp as ever, and the ending cutscene plays out.

Lately though the number of hours of my free time I'm putting into gaming has increased massively, and I'm trying to figure out why, and if that's a good or bad thing.

On the plus side, a lot of my favourite genres/franchises have been having very successful entries like MGS Delta, Silent Hill f etc. Since probably AstroBot, I feel like there has been a top tier game for me to play every few weeks, and I recently got a Switch 2, after skipping the Switch, and so have a bunch of first party Nintendo games to catch up on. So the quality of games out there and how much I am enjoying them is a big factor.

# Aeruta

There has been a trend of games where you fight for ingredients and run a shop. The sprites got me into this one and I ended up sticking with it due to the charming cast and polished combat. The game is lighter on the management side of things than others and I like not having a million chores to do. It is more dialogue-heavy than most of its competition, but the text boxes go by fast.

# Vivid Knight

[PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569090/Vivid_Knight/), Switch, Mobile

I tend to drop auto-battlers pretty quickly, but this one managed to hold my interest. It's turn based which makes it easier to see how your strategy is working out. There is an ""upgrade"" system that makes use of duplicates, but upgraded units simply apply their traits after being removed rather than becoming stronger, so you'll end up shifting your team around rather than focusing on getting the most value out of a single strong unit.

# Road to Ballhalla

[PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/425410/Road_to_Ballhalla/), PS4, Xbox One

This is a rhythmic avoidance game similar to the Bound custom maps from the Starcraft UMS days. The maps are fun and there's not much more to say about it. If you're into the genre, you'll enjoy Road to Ballhalla.

# Moékuri: Adorable + Tactical SRPG

[PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/529160/Moekuri_Adorable__Tactical_SRPG/)

I initially thought the tiles made the game look cheap, but then I realized the simple art allows the game to easily include terraforming effects. The game has an astounding amount of mechanics in addition to terraforming and allows for a very large assortment of strategies. It is also a game where strategy is important and not a braindead RPG with grid based movement.

# Kamifuda

[PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1937720/Kamifuda/)

This is a singleplayer deckbuilder in the vein of old school portable card video games like Pokemon TCG for Gameboy rather than modern rogue-lite stuff. That said, it feels like a puzzle game as the protagonist canonically rewinds time after losing to an opponent and builds a deck to counter their strategy. The gameplay is solid and I personally enjoyed the eldritch setting.

# Brave × Junction

[PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3364830/Brave_x_Junction/), PS5

While this is tagged as ""adults only"" on Steam, there's only 1 version and it's listed as Teen on the PlayStation store. The gameplay is Blackjack and whoever wins the round gets to deal damage. Each character has a variety of skills to skew the odds in your favour or deal more/take less damage. It's simple but way more fun than it has any right to be.

# I Am Fish

[PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1472560/I_Am_Fish/), Xbox One

It's a physics-based platformer in which you play as a fish and use various means of locomotion to escape captivity and reunite with your fish friends in open waters. It's reasonably challenging but not rage-bait; the mechanics aren't weird or wonky. Simple, but fun.

# Disc Room

[PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229580/Disc_Room/), Xbox One, Switch

This is like a bullet hell but without monsters to fight, so more of a bullet survival. While the core gameplay is simple the game includes a ton of gimmicks to make the content feel sufficiently varied.

# Crown Trick

[PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1000010/Crown_Trick/), PS4, Xbox One, Switch

In this roguelike there is a boss after every main floor, so you can both plan around them and not worry about having to grind your way through several floors to stumble upon one. Minor mobs have a ton of gimmicks to keep things interesting but go down quickly so fighting your way through them doesn't become a slog. This is a solid roguelike that doesn't overstay its welcome.

# Road to Empress

[PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3478050/Road_To_Empress/)

I've enjoyed watching some Asian television dramas and the quality here makes it feel very much like watching one of those.

These corporations have become so fixated on profits and the stock market that they forgot that the gaming industry is primarily an entertainment industry. If people have an option to play something better (and in this case cheaper) they will.

So we see that happening right now. I think it's a total of 6 ""Indie"" games in the past 4 weeks that sold a combined total of 8 million copies. Developers are seeing what corporations now lack in their video games: Passion.

The mass layoffs for short term profits are encouraging these talented developers to form smaller teams that simply make good games. And we're all going to play them in substitute of the AAA slop that gets thrown at us with pushy microtransactions and addictive, manipulative strategies we're growing privy to.

1ospk8a,[OC] 6 scales of video game complexity for beginner gamers (infographic),gaming,1762710175.0,3557,0,False,"Inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/metroidvania/comments/1os2a15/the_sliding_scale_of_exploration_guidance/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), I decided to rank video games in 6 different scales of complexity.

The idea is to help people who are trying to get into gaming, but consider it to be too daunting to learn at first (if you have watched Razbuten's series on ""gaming for non-gamers"", you know what I'm talking about). People can use this scale to help them find games that are not too hard for them to learn how to play.

The thing is that this learning complexity may be separated into multiple axes, given that some people may struggle more with some things (e.g. quick reflexes) and some people may struggle with others (e.g. moving the character and the camera at the same time).

Thus, I have separated game complexity into 6 axis. Each game could be placed in a location within each of the 6 axis:

1. How hard the game's challenges are to beat

2. How much the game requires fast reaction times

3. How much the game demands moving the character and the camera at the same time

4. How many buttons the game requires

5. How complicated the game mechanics are to understand

6. How much the game guides you towards the objectives

The idea would be for beginner gamers to start with games which are low in all 6 scales, and slowly progress up through each of the 6 scales until they are capable of playing almost everything.

 would be also quite helpful if we had some kind of guide or app that lets people classify popular games in these 6 criteria, and then it would recommend games to beginner gamers to progress through them.

1or6gt5,Ghost of Yotei is the most well crafted bad game I've ever played.,gaming,1762549980.0,0,0,False,"Might just be sick of open world game design but the game is just filled with monotonous garbage.

It's incredibly pretty, and it's at least not frustrating to play but it's genuinely not fun.

Main critiques:
-tired open world design. 1 million things to do on the map and none of it is thst compelling or fun. Follow a fox for five minutes. Climb up a mountain that isn't challenging in any way. Get into the same boring fights

-combat. (This might be a personal preference  situation) it's annoying when games force you to block or parry in order to damage enemies. Blocking and parrying should be imo options in combat that reward timing and mastery but not requirements. Every fight ends up being using a quick fire tool or just sitting around waiting to parry or guard break in order to get lethal damage. It's border line lock and key game play and it sucks. It's time gating with extra steps. 

-combat (part 2). Actual lock and key gameplay. The weapon selection system to counter other weapons is just boring. And the controls for swapping don't feel great. Tons of times where I think i swapped weapons but I didn't give it enough time or something. If you don't use the correct weapon you seem to be heavily penalized. Combat is so boring that I usually choose stealth options to avoid having to fight. Boss fights exaggerate the issue because they are so long. 

Additionally the fact that enemies basically warp towards you with attacks there is no maintaining spacing in a fight. If an enemy queues up an attack it will hit you if you dont block parry or dodge. Your are basically never just out of range of an attack. It just forces you into one way to play.

-writing/ story. Also personal preference but I think it's just genuinely bad. There is so much dialog in this game that doesn't matter. Characters just talking with 0 consequence. And it's such a long game it ends up wasting so much of your time talking to a random npc about how they've been wronged so go kill a bunch of dudes. I don't know how anyone plays the game without wanting to skip everything they can. Other people have talked about how it's just a boring revenge plot. It is but what makes this worse is all the characters are so boring and dont have any interesting perspectives or character traits. Whole things feels undercooked, which is weird because there is so much writing in the game. They clearly spent alot of time on this.

Closing thoughts:
The game is really pretty and clearly a lot of time and effort went into it but it's amazing how under cooked and tired it's design is. I had similar issues with it's predecessor ghost of tsushima but it seems exaggerated in yotei.  It's just not fun and a chore to play, but again really pretty to look at. ",True

Servers down during peak hours? Adapt.

Meanwhile, devs were killing themselves with late-night fixes that never got approved, because leadership didn’t want to “confuse the data” from playtests.
Translation: metrics > gameplay.

The worst part? A known exploit went live for three consecutive patches.
Players literally made a meme out of it. YouTubers roasted the studio.
When someone from the design team begged to push a hotfix, management shut it down because there was a “community showcase” event coming up and “we can’t afford bad optics.”So instead of patching, they ran influencer tournaments on a broken build.
And when players complained? The boss told the dev team,

“Don’t argue, just remind them we value feedback.”

My cousin said there was even a private Slack channel called #please-dont-mention-the-bugs.

The game’s population tanked. Players blamed the devs, not realizing the people who actually could fix things weren’t allowed to touch them.

So yeah, next time you see a studio post “we’re listening to the community,”
just remember: someone in a meeting probably said,

“It’s fine. The players will adapt.”",True

""Hey everyone, R* Employee of many years here!

 

Understandably I want to remain anonymous due to retaliation from the Company, but I may be willing to verify I'm an employee with @Spider-Vice via DM (if required). I am also a member of the Union.

 

I've been reading a lot of the discussion on here and elsewhere about the firing of more than 34 of my colleagues last week (31 in the UK + 3 in Canada) and have seen a lot of disinformation and lies that are really concerning. Particularly concerning how so many folk are willing to believe the Company's excuses.

 

Last week, my colleagues who were in the studio were each individually messaged by HR for a short friendly meeting, under the friendly guise of ""Hey, are you free for a quick chat?""

 

Upon attending this meeting they were handed an envelope with a short letter stating that their employment had been terminated for ""gross misconduct"" regarding posts made in Discord.

 

They failed to provide any evidence when asked, nor was any stated in the letter. And did not divulge any other information or reasoning - ""and no other reason""

 

They refused their right to Union representation in the disciplinary meeting (which is against UK employment law) and were frogmarched out of the studio with the meeting lasting less than 5 minutes.

 

For colleagues who were not in the Studio that day, they received a phone call from HR that lasted less than 2 minutes telling them they were fired and that they'd receive the same letter as above. I am aware of one employee who had a panic attack at this moment, and HR hung up on them during this panic attack not caring at all about their wellbeing.

 

These colleagues of mine were hard workers who have spent many many years at R* in critical roles. With colleagues who have been at R* for more that 18 years and none of them have ever had a disciplinary in that time. They are not easily replaced and will certainly affect us in making our project deadlines.

 

These are very senior artists, animators, QA testers, designers, programmers and producers. Including Leads. All super talented people who were proud of their work over multiple R* titles, and all they wanted was the best for R* and their fellow colleagues.

 

Some of these members were off sick, recovering from surgery or on paternity leave. Fired without pay, losing their careers and putting them into hardship in the lead up to Christmas, and even potentially losing their VISAs to work in the UK. 

 

Let me make this clear! I never saw any discussion/leaking of Rockstar projects in the Union Discord. The only ever discussion was around unionisation efforts and the working conditions at R*. The Discord wasn't public. It was a private Discord group that only contained R* employees and the IWGB Union officials.

 

This was Union Busting and nothing else! Everyone fired was a Union Member, they were also predominantly from those who were on the Union Organising Committees of each UK studio.

 

Just one week before, the Union had reached ~200 members taking us over the 10% threshold required to seek recognition and begin engaging in collective bargaining. Allowing us to negotiate directly with management on the key issues that affect us: worsening crunch, inadequate pay and inflexible working arrangements.

 

They have fired over 34 of us now. There were over 250 of us in that Union/Employee Discord group. There is the fear that if they get away with this, they'll have nothing stopping them from doing this again and again.

Those of us who are lucky and remain for now work in fear! Fearful when talking to each other at the tea prep, fearful that we're next in line and are easily got rid of, too scared to go outside the studio and talk to (or even acknowledge) our colleagues outside protesting in fear of reprisals. Morale in the studio is at rock bottom. When we should be excited about what's to come over the next year we are now totally deflated and our trust and confidence in others is totally shot.

 

Which is the truly heartbreaking part, as for us in the Union, all of our ambition was to make R* a happier, fairer, safer and more equitable place. That's all. What has happened clearly shows that we care more about the wellbeing of our colleagues at Rockstar than the Company does.

 

The union remains unbowed and is fighting to win the reinstatement of every dismissed member of staff at Rockstar through legal means and campaigning. 

 

This fight is critical, if Rockstar can get away with this, they will keep treating their workers with disdain, disrespect, and subjecting them to continued illegal treatment.

 

Thanks for your time, and I hope this is some truth that helps you all understand what's going on here at the moment.

 

I you would be so kind, you can contribute to the fundraiser to support those fighting their dismissal here: https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/support-rockstar-workers-fighting-unfair-dismissals/

 

It would be really appreciated if you could also share the above link. I won’t be cross posting this to other forums, but please feel free to share.

I’m 50s, and prefer to invert in pretty much every game for both mouse and controller. I think (and I’m told by the internet) that it’s because I started playing games when the old-school joystick was in use and playing flight sim games with that.

Today I was starting a new game and wondered if the only reason “invert y-axis” still exists is for gen-x and older millenial gamers, or if there’s more to it than “we grew up playing flight sims with a joystick”, and younger gamers do it too.

Edit: /u/jtho78 (and /u/SailorJerrry ) posted this article talking about a scientific study done on this topic. From the article:
“In short, gamers think they are an inverter or a non-inverter because of how they were first exposed to game controls. Someone who played a lot of flight sims in the 1980s may have unconsciously taught themselves to invert and now they consider that their innate preference; alternatively a gamer who grew up in the 2000s, when non-inverted controls became prevalent may think they are naturally a non-inverter. However, cognitive tests suggest otherwise. It’s much more likely that you invert or don’t invert due to how your brain perceives objects in 3D space.”

1oq6g68,What can be described as a *good* game?,gaming,1762452977.0,0,0,False,"With all the discussion about game quality, I was wondering this: what can we qualify as a **good** game?

TLDR: IMO, a good game gave me some fun. What is your definition?

-----

With more details, for me, this is what I expected for a game to be good. 

Good doesn't mean perfect, it doesn't mean an immediate classic. It could have a lot of default, or none. An excellent game is good in general, and a buggy game could still be kind of good. And mostly: a good game **cannot** please everyone!

For me, a games is good as long as I have fun with it. May it be because of the gameplay, the story or the beautiful art and sceneries; all of which that makes me enjoy my time with the game (be it with a sad or happy tones). May it be a flash game or an AAAA game; a very narrative or a gameplay focused game.

I feel like nowadays, we doesn't want games to be good, we want them to be PERFECT, and you cannot have fun if it is not. And don't even expect having fun on a 13/20 game, or in a game where John Doe said they didn't like the character design. If someone doesn't like the game, it cannot be good for anybody.

Maybe I'm too nice with games, but I feel like a game doesn't need to be a potential goty to be good

Cyberpunk was bunged as shit at launch, but it still is a good game to play. Hogwarts Legacy universe come from the mind of a transphobic person, but it is a good play. FIFA and CoD are always the same shit, but gamer have a good moment playing them. Pokémon games are created with only a few pennies and not enough cares compared to the fortune Pokémon Compagnie have and could invest, owning the biggest franchise on earth. But you can still have fun with the little monsters

I mean, yes, some games exist and are loved by the whole world for their near-perfection. And obviously I know it's a subjective matter, so you cannot make everyone 100% happy. But still. There are some of those games that are loved by a very vast majority of players who played them, like :

Zelda Ocarina of Time

Elden Ring

Expedition 33

Hollow Knight

Outer Wilds

Red Dead Redemption 2

All these games are considered as master pieces in their own category for the passion that has been poured in their development.

Especially Expedition 33, which is a prime example of what you get when you just take good ideas from other games and put them in one single game, play them, like what you made, and then release it.

As a player for now around 33 years, I'm deeply passionate about video games and I love to understand how they are made, what is good, what is not, what can be improved, and I always search in the smallest details of gameplay, feeling, sound, graphics, etc... to see what could be improved or not. And by doing that, I can determine features that would simply add fun to the game.

Let's take the example of Elden Ring : once you finished the game, you can replay NG+ as much as you want, but it's always a linear experience. What if there was a randomizer to spice up your future runs ? What if you just added a boss rush mode ? It doesn't seem impossible to do, since people make mods in that regard. These two options would drastically increase the fun time you can have on such a game. Lords of the Fallen 2023 did it, they included a randomizer in their game after an update (shoutout to them for that). From Software could, but they won't. Why ? 

Also sometimes we see games releasing with a lot of potential, but this potential ends up not being exploited at all. Number one game for this is Dragon's Dogma 2. The level of cope on their subreddit (i'm part of it lol) is too damn high. They hope for a DLC that will probably never release.

Yes, I know, there are some money considerations to have, but some people show us that money can be put out of the equation if you take your time and pour all of your passion in the game you are making. Silksong is a pretty good example of a game where devs just made their dream game, without compromise. They released a game according to their own vision, without constraint.

And obviously, all of these games are a mix of ideas that previously existed in previous games. Elden Ring is the grand child of Zelda Ocarina of Time in terms of gameplay with the lock-on feature and the general slow action gameplay. All of the souls games that came before are also what made Elden Ring such a GOAT. Michael Zaki and From Software had a VISION (this word is important) and they kept that vision all throughout development, to obtain the best possible game in the end (for them, as it's still possible to enhance it as I said before with mods and such).

Therefore I assume that if I had the means to have a team of people as passionate as me, I could be the game designer of the best game ever. I could put everything I like from every game I loved, but all in one single game. My game would have the things I find the most fun and addictive, my game would NOT have the things that everyone agrees to hate, my game would feel and sound crispy, crunchy and yummy. I see no reason why I should restrain the game design of my game other than money.

Let's say that for some reason I have, indeed, the money and the team to do the game I want (and many other people actually want too). What would I do ?

The answer is Expedition 33. I think it's the demonstration of passionate people using all the tools we have in modern times to make the game they loved. And it's beautiful to see how fun and good their game can be when they don't have stupid marketing people deciding for them, or stupid deadlines ruining the release of the game. It's just guys who think like me, who went like ""let's make the BEST turn based rpg ever, guys"". Let's go.

So I hope in the future, more people will do the same, since we have the tools for this nowadays, and there is obviously a LOT of money available to finance these things. Right now, where the money is flowing the most, is where the minds are rotten. Blizzard, EA, Ubisoft, all of those dead companies are just slaves to marketing people. But studios who can stay free from those schackles now have the means to do these games. If concerned editors rise in this scenario, editors who can actually finance true passion, then we are blessed with a very bright future for video games.

Anyway thanks for reading all of this.

TL;DR : give me the means and I give you the game you always dreamt about. Some other people might think the same as me and actually did it (Expedition 33 for example). Future is bright if more people do this.",True

1oppx90,Borderlands 4 Casual Gamer Review,gaming,1762404794.0,0,0,False,"7/10

 

I am not the hardcore gamer type. I’ve played video games my entire life, but always for fun. I feel like there’s a lot of gamers out there like me who mostly just lurk this sub like I have done for the past many years but never post anything, and I hope to speak to them with this. Also, I posted a TLDR at the bottom if you want the short of it. I don't spoil any major plot points in here, but as always if you don't want to be spoiled at all, don't read this.

 

Let me just start with this: I am a huge Borderlands fan. I’ve played all of the Borderlands games from start to finish, though I’ve enjoyed some more than others. I’m one of the people in the minority that genuinely very much enjoyed Borderlands 3, even with all of its….not good dialogue. The gameplay though? It was such a huge step up for me from Borderlands 2 that it really sucked me in. I also played a good amount of Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands. It didn’t click with me at first, but eventually I ended up enjoying it enough for what it was. Anyways, Borderlands 4.

 

Gameplay: Easily the strongest point of the game, the combat is incredibly satisfying and rewarding. I have done two play-throughs now (first was with Harlowe, second with Rafa) and I enjoyed both of the characters for different reasons.  I tried multiple builds for each and while enjoying all of them, it did feel to me that some are just way stronger than others. The movement, grappling hook and jetpack all come together seamlessly most of the time to create that feeling of being the baddest of the bad in the firefight. My only complaint here is that at times it felt like I would get stuck after using a dash and leave myself in bad situations. But I also kinda think that’s fair. Git gud and all that.

 

Story: For the most part, I enjoyed the story. Nothing overly complicated or deep, but definitely a more serious tone than Borderlands 3. There’s a big bad, he’s got 3 big henchman you must take out, and there’s a twist. I enjoyed the characters for the most part, although at times some of them felt a little underdeveloped. The returning characters were great but I miss some of the manufacturers. I do hate having to slowly walk behind characters as they give exposition, and that is something you’ll just have to get used to in this game. So boo on that. Sometimes you can run to the next objective early, but sometimes you have to wait for them to finish their spiel to give you something, you just never know.

 

Side quests and collectibles: The side quests are awesome, and some of the collectibles are fun…but there really are just so  many. It’s a large map with lots of stuff to find, so if you’re into that, you’re gonna have a great time. If not, I would say probably turn down the difficulty a bit so you can run through the story without needing all of the experience from the side quests. 

 

Guns and Loot: Now this is what the game is all about right? Getting guns that really fit your playstyle and causing maximum damage. There were times during this game that I’d have four different guns I loved all at once, and I’d just cycle through them fight to fight on a whim. However, after a while those guns would be too weak, and I’d find myself at a point where none of my guns felt fun anymore. So you change it up, and then you end up trying guns that you don’t like. For example, I genuinely don’t understand why you’d use a lot of the torque weapons that shoot the slower rockets. You can’t hit anyone at range because the enemies are constantly moving. As for sniper rifles, why use anything other than a Jacobs that gives massive damage per shot without having to reload each time? If anyone out there uses a Maliwan sniper, please explain...I don't understand them. Most of the guns are great, and the unique guns always bring something fun and different which makes for some great moments. As for loot, if you’re playing on anything under hard, you’re going to be disappointed.

 

Technical Stuff: Now look I’m not a game dev or anything like that so I generally will give passes to games that don’t run perfectly if they’re fun to play. But if you quit playing BL4 because you couldn’t deal with the massive amount of bugs? Completely understand. Here’s a list of what I’ve dealt with: 1) the game loses frames the longer you play it…I don’t really know how to justify this it really sucks. 2) Sometimes during quests, you will be forced to “Clear all forces” or whatever, and one of those guys will somehow clip through the environment and you have to close the game and restart it to redo the entire fight and hope it doesn’t happen again….incredibly infuriating. 3) since the newest patch, if I put my PS5 in rest mode with the game still open, I will receive an error message and the game will close when I try to get back in. So I’m forced to close the game every time I decide I’m done playing, which really isn’t that big of a deal, but I definitely shouldn’t have to do it. 4) as a lot of people have said, the map is terrible, giving useless routes when you ping where you’re trying to go, which is rather annoying.

 

All in all, I really do love this game. I hope some things are fixed, but it will be a game I return to when I’m not feeling anything else for quite a while.

1opb4gg,"[IGN] Inside Dante’s Purgatorio, the Cancelled Sequel to EA’s Dante’s Inferno | The game was penned by Assassin’s Creed 2 co-writer Joshua Rubin as a battle between Heaven and Hell",gaming,1762367773.0,356,0,False,"The article is incredibly thorough about the *entire* script of the game's 11 levels: **Level 1: Dream in Eden , Level 2: At the Shores of Purgatory , Level 3: Ante-Purgatory , Levels 4 and 5: Pride / Envy , Level 6: Wrath , Levels 7, 8, and 9: Sloth, Greed, and Gluttony , Level 10: Lust , Level 11: The Garden of Eden**

\- The entirety of Inferno 2’s campaign is set on Mount Purgatory. Described by Knight as the “inverse of Hell,” this mountain is divided into nine tiers – or terraces – themed after the Seven Deadly Sins of Pride, Envy, Wrath, Sloth, Greed, Gluttony, and Lust, with a giant gate at its cliffside base and the Garden of Eden at its seemingly unreachable summit. Each terrace acts as a campaign stage, complete with its own challenges, puzzles, enemies, and Vision Cave (more on those later.)

\- For the sequel, Dante would once again be outfitted with his cross, which can smite foes with blasts of Holy energy, and a scythe. While this scythe would have looked and felt distinct from the one used in the first game, the developers didn’t want them to be too different. “Dante’s Inferno players really liked the weapon,” a former Visceral employee explained, “which could expand and retract and swing around like Kratos’ blades of Chaos. We’d built a dedicated combat team that actually included people who worked on God of War, so we knew we shouldn’t try to completely reinvent the wheel.”

\- Complimenting these weapons would be a suite of new spiritual abilities, which Dante acquires throughout the campaign. The first is Spirit Jump, a skill that allows him to leap across vast distances. Following that, he learns to take control of enemies (Possession), avoid certain attacks (Spirit Dodge), run at high speeds (Spirit Dash), and – during major boss fights – sprout angelic wings that allow him to fly. To use these and other powers, the player must fill up their “Faith Meter,” which allows them to enter “Spirit Mode,” a power-up that transforms Dante into an ethereal version of himself.

\- Dante, too, must redeem himself if he wishes to reach Eden. To that end, each terrace sees Dante and Virgil search for a “Vision Cave”, where Dante relives an episode from his past in which he gave in to one of the Seven Deadly Sins.

\- Scriptwriter Joshua Rubin says he envisioned these caves as “playable cutscenes” inspired by immersive theater productions like Sleep No More. “Dante – in Spirit Mode – moves through his memories like a ghost, reliving moments of sin that shaped his love story with Beatrice back in Florence,” he explains. At the end of these gameplay sequences, Dante fights “grotesque” personifications of his sins, literally defeating the demons inside him.

Upon exiting each Vision Cave, you would have received a power-up from Lucia, followed by an opportunity to make a gameplay choice that signifies Dante’s moral growth. On the Terrace of Envy, for example, you would have been able to risk your life to save an NPC, thus demonstrating compassion, envy’s opposite.

Traversal would have played a much bigger part in this game than it did in the original. According to one former Visceral employee, “Probably the most innovative and interesting thing we wanted to do with Purgatory, which is about ascending up to Heaven as opposed to descending down into Hell, was the climbing. Jonathan \[Knight\] told us: ‘I want this to be the best climbing game out there, better than Uncharted or Tomb Raider.’ Unlike those games, where pushing the stick glued you to a wall, we wanted to keep you on \[your\] toes and instill a real sense of vertigo.”

Climbing segments would have been akin to puzzles, with the player searching for graspable ledges, avoiding crumbling rocks and ranged enemy attacks, and helping companion characters ascend along with you. Midway through the campaign, Dante would have unlocked an ability that reveals previously unseen “Angelic Architecture,” structures normally visible only to angels and redeemed souls, opening up new routes through the environment.

**Visceral planned for Dante’s Inferno 2 to include co-op and multiplayer modes. These were included out of necessity – as one former employee puts it, “This was a time when every game needed to have DLC and online play because companies were afraid of people selling their discs back to GameStop” – and partly out of a desire to build on the foundation of Trials of St. Lucia, a DLC pack for the first game which added battle arenas that could be played co-operatively with another player.**

**Although work on co-op and multiplayer had hardly gotten off the ground when EA pulled the plug, employees recall that the modes would have followed an angels-versus-demons format, with players being able to fight for either side. One employee had vague recollections of a map where players had to defend and board airships.**

-Very well crafted open world with some solid and rewarding exploration and resource gathering/crafting without feeling tedious. Side missions are crafted care and make sense instead of being cookie cutter box checkers. 


-Well paced progression as you slowly become more powerful and capable of taking on hordes thanks to some well designed variety of combat options. 


-Combat offers numerous strategies as you go, from traps, custom melee weapons, explosives(exploding knives are so so satisfying), to guns that give you just enough ammo to use now and then when you really need them. 


-Melee mechanics feel really nice and enemy variety is solid considering it’s either zombies or the occasional group of humans. It’s simple but feels great. Aiming for body parts works well as the controls are accurate and there are some brutal finishers. Not the to the same degree as Dead Island 2 but it gets the job done. 


-Level and world design are really impressive. There are a lot of buildings to explore, both small and large, some underground areas, open spaces, etc.  


-Parkour mechanics are great, and getting around the world doesn’t take too long. If you need to travel longer distances it’s it too hard to find a car. 


-Beast mode is satisfying without being too overpowered. 


-World size feels perfect and the setting feels refreshing.

Squires has personally ordered, at his own initiative, his organization to take another look at Nintendo’s U.S. Patent No. 12,403,397.

The one game that comes to mind is Nier Automata, but that game is pretty depressing, so it's not exactly great for a de-stressing session after work.

The Horizon games have nice worlds to explore and relax in, but they're primarily focused on ranged combat. The Arkham games are set in Gotham which is fairly dreary. The Spiderman games are set in New York which isn't what I'm looking for.

The closest total package that I can really think of are the Breath of the Wild games, but I find the combat a bit lacking in those games. They're great for other reasons, but I don't really want to deal with the equipment management of them.

Souls-likes feel too heavy and slow in their combat. I just want to mash a bit and pull off some flashy stuff with relative ease.

Nothing anyone has put any real effort into, at least.

For those that weren't around; this arcade game was a phenomenon and likely a large reason why the show became as popular as it did in the first place. It was a technical marvel at the time and set a standard for how to treat a popular IP with respect.

That last part is the thing that sparks my intrigue as an adult. How did this Japanese company barely anyone knew (relatively speaking) at the time come out of nowhere and nail the aesthetic and overall soul of the most popular IP of the 90's so damned well?

This was before the proliferation of internet. What did that kind of collaboration even look like?

This game seems to be something of a marvel to me. Two things:

1. I did not realize this thing was in creation during the [first season](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/The_Simpsons_Arcade_Game?utm_source=chatgpt.com), according to some conversations I've seen. This makes me more curious about what the creators wanted from the IP in general.
2. Related to 1: I was in my preteens when this game was released in Arcades, and as such, I think it's been verified by Einstein that there's some kind of time dilation effect that happens during this stage of a person's life - because it felt like ""The Simpsons"" as a franchise had been around *forever at this point*, before I first ran into that Arcade Machine for the first time at ""The Palace"" skating rink all those years ago.

I really need a thorough behind-the-scenes documentary on this thing. Someone please get on this!

Imagine how fucking pathetic you have to be as a human being for wanting to straight shit on someone that just wants to express excitement for talking about the Simpsons due to one throwaway line. The tone of some of these comments are fucking unreal.

These days, I struggle to get hooked on modern titles the same way I did back then.

I spend most of my gaming time using emulators on PC, and while that should scratch the itch, it doesn’t quite do it. Emulators can be hit or miss — some games run beautifully, while others are a complete mess. On top of that, tracking down certain games is a pain. Most of the companies that made them don’t sell them anymore, resellers jack up the prices, and thanks to internet censorship, even finding “free” options is getting harder.

Sony and Microsoft at least make an effort to bring some sixth-gen titles to modern platforms — not all, but a fair few. I’ll give Microsoft credit: they really go the extra mile with smoother performance and visual upgrades on Xbox. Nintendo, on the other hand, will just pick a random game or two, slap an anniversary label on it, and charge a ridiculous amount.

- Realism: I prefer games that feel real. If I shoot someone in the head, I expect them to stay dead. I'm not a big fan of games like doom, where you have to kill the Lord of Hell, and 200 bullets to his head aren't enough to kill him. Also, a game where I can only take a few shots before dying, because I'm playing a normal guy, without superpowers.   
- Story: I'm looking for a game where I am fighting a war that makes sense. I'm not looking for shooting just for the sake of shooting.   
- Tactics: a game that rewards thinking, rather than shooting millions of bullets. However, a few fast-paced sections sometimes are fine.

1olvrdl,Unique and Well-Designed Gameplay Mechanics in Video Games,gaming,1762023106.0,18,0,False,"There are different game genres built around a specific type of player interaction — for example, FPS games. The core mechanics there are well-known and established, so developers usually focus on expanding the world, lore, or the variety of weapons.

But some games manage to discover a truly great gameplay mechanic — one so strong that the entire game is built around it. Often, the world itself isn’t deeply developed, yet that single unique mechanic is enough to make the game stand out and feel complete.

* **Haven (air sliding)**
* **The Pathless (target shot improvement)**

1olahdf,Got a new idea for a game,gaming,1761956372.0,0,0,False,"It's Halloween.  You have a phobia of children and having it interact with people but will give out candy to face your fear.  You have two meters: an anxiety meter and a candy meter.

Parents and kids will come to your door.  If it's one to four kids, you anxiety meter is fine.  It's a whole group of parents with five to twelve kids, your anxiety meter will fill steadily.  When they leave, your anxiety meter will go down slowly.  However, if your anxiety meter gets too high, you'll freak out, run into your house, bolting it and shutting off the front porch light.  

You must also keep track of how much candy you are giving out.  If you run out while more kids are coming, you'll also freak out, lock up the house and shut off the lights, and run to your room.

If you are able to keep calm and manage your candy well, you'll be fine.

All three scenarios that I have listed will have a similar ending with you going to your room and do your annual viewing of Hocus Pocus hoping this year that the Sanderson Sisters will win even though you know they won't.  It's how you've handled things that determines how well you enjoy your viewing, though.

Oh, and there's some freaky dude that you catch watching you every so often.  If it turns 8 'o clock, you have a high anxiety meter and little candy left, he will appear right in front of your face saying ""Do I scare you?""  You have two responses - 1) say yes and get a jump scare that gives your character a heart attack and dies or 2) have your character verbally lash out at the creature by saying ""NO!  NO, YOU DON'T SCARE ME!  I FACED A BUNCH OF LITTLE KIDS WITH GIANT EYES LOOKING UP AT MY 5'10"" 350 LBS MALE PATTERN BALDNESS ASS IN APPREHENSION FOR THE LAST TWO HOURS!  I HAVE FACED MY FEAR!

Stuff like having a left and right hand weapon but also having weapons strapped to your thighs like throwing knives and explosives. 

It would be a Medieval fantasy type game where customizing your body and armor opens up options for exploring dungeons and hunting. 

Think something like a more grounded monster hunter with magic and motion inputs for certain weapon techniques. 

Not sure if I'm explaining this well. 

Basically a melee action adventure game, where the weapon and armor customization functions very similar to the Armored Core games, and melee combat similar to Zelda or Monster Hunter.

1ol6n49,"The sad state of ""Junk car, survival, life simulators""",gaming,1761945703.0,0,0,False,"My Summer Car is one of the greatest games ever made. Beneath it's admittedly modest presentation lays a diamond in the rough. Many games let you fix cars and many games let you drive cars but few games let you do both. But it's not just a survival/life simulator game. It's a unique game with great humor that oozes with charm. And it's all made by one guy, which is very impressive. It also somewhat justifies the less than great visual presentation, which to be honest contributes to the game's unique feel. 

There was definitely a good idea there, and one that could be expanded on. Surely enough not long after discovering My Summer Car I discovered another game in the same vein called Jalopy. Much like MSC it too featured a gameplay loop centered around keeping a pile of junk alive, but it expanded on the idea by featuring procedurally generated maps and a bigger focus on story telling. A great, though admittedly short, experience. But fret not, for there was so much that could be done with the groundwork laid, and surely enough games were coming out left and right iterating on the idea and expanding it. All we had to do was just wait for the genre to come into its own. 

And nearly ten years on, it's never really gotten better than that. A quick glance on Steam for simillar games and you're showered with copy cats and clones of pretty much just the two games I mentioned. Some are ok, basically just more of a good thing. Most, however, are just abandoned early access projects with unfulfilled promises and reduced scopes. All way past their full release deadlines, all scaling back down on their initial plans, pretty much none truly expanding on the formula in any particular way. While there are some gems in there, as in games that offer a decent experience, none are really surpassing MSC or Jalopy in what they offer. Jalopy clones are really bad, since the nature of the game means that they're little more than procedurally generated slop with more and more low effort assets dumped into them periodically. MSC clones are even worse, with some standouts like Mon Bazou existing, but there's always some compromise being made. Some look downright horrible despite being fun to play if you get past that. Some are just aimless, with none of the charm or purpose that made MSC great, some are just straight up copies. You can only brew moonshine and run rallies so many times before it gets boring. 

I guess I'm just venting here. I understand that most of these games are single person projects and it's an uphill battle to bring a project like that to completion, but I can't help but feel sad that games like MSC and Jalopy gave me an itch I can't scratch. Despite seemingly being interest in the genre, no one has actually come around to fill that demand. I recently played Junkyard Truck which was cool and all for a few hours but I soon realised that what I was playing was more or less what we're getting. Dev has no real plans to expand the game much further and it's not long after you get over the early game that you find yourself to be roaming aimlessly.

1okkhkz,The Outer Worlds 2 - A mixed review after the first 15 hours,gaming,1761882141.0,125,0,False,"I went into The Outer Worlds 2 with optimism. I wasn’t a huge fan of the first game even tough I finished it. TOW2 tries a bit too hard with the “comedy,” feels kind of bland overall, and the combat leans too much into bullet spongy enemies for my taste. Still, I was curious to see if Obsidian would take things up a notch later.

Unfortunately, even though The Outer Worlds 2 is technically better than the first, it’s not much of a step up. It still lags behind Obsidian’s older games in terms of storytelling, character writing, and quest design. The world just doesn’t have that spark, it feels like a prettier (but not that pretty) version of what we already got. I think I liked what they did with Avowed better.

The gameplay is definitely smoother, and I can’t deny it’s a solid classic-style RPG where you can build your character and approach quests however you want. There’s a certain charm to the setting and tone, and when it clicks, it does remind me why Obsidian is still respected in the RPG space.

But overall, it feels very formulaic. The factions, the choices, the open ended perks and weaknesses,it all funnels toward the same kinds of outcomes, and it never really surprises you. The humor still feels forced, and the story doesn’t grab you the way it should.

In a year full of great RPGs, I just can’t justify spending or money on something that feels this familiar. It’s not bad just uninspired. But I already have Gamepass and no other game on my list at the moment which is why I am still trying to find the spark. 

I think the critics score is a bit high tbh, I would give it a solid 7.

TL;DR: The Outer Worlds 2 is a competent sequel that plays well but plays it too safe. Better than the first, sure, but still missing that special spark that made Obsidian’s older games memorable.

Many of the games listed are not exactly unknown, just average (like Sacred 3) or not very good (like Dunegon Siege 3). But some are honestly very obscure. I never knew Requittal existed, or Warlander, which I would've loved to try. I didn't know Blood Rayne 2 got a remastered version too.

1okiivd,Used Halliday to buy a Valorant skin on payments and instantly regretted it,gaming,1761876264.0,0,0,False,"I tried this new thing called Halliday that lets you buy now and pay later for in-game stuff. It sounded harmless at first. I was low on cash but really wanted one of the new Valorant skins, the Oni Phantom bundle, so I figured I’d just split it up. It cost around $80 total, and they offered a plan that was $30 up front and the rest over the next couple of months.

For about a week everything worked fine. Then my next payment date came and I completely forgot about it. The charge failed, and when I logged into Valorant the skin was gone. No warning, no “your payment failed,” just missing from my locker like it never existed.

I emailed Halliday support and they replied a day later saying I would regain access once the account was in good standing. That was it. No time frame, no help, nothing. So now I have paid $30, don’t have the skin, and feel like an idiot for financing pixels.

I get that it was my fault for missing the payment, but it still feels shady that a service can just reach into your account and take away something you already paid part of. I didn’t even know that was possible.

If anyone here is thinking about trying Halliday to grab skins or loot boxes, seriously just wait until you can afford it. The idea of game now pay later sounds fun until you realize it is basically microtransactions on credit.

1okgulv,Arc Raiders - GenAI and the Ethics of it,gaming,1761871574.0,0,0,False,"I know this is probably gonna be review bombed, but I still want to ask, what is the deal then with the generative AI in Arc Raiders, and why are they being so vague about it? Steam says that it was used in development but ""*In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team.""* Which means nothing. That's like saying you asked Chat-GPT to make a photo and since you put the prompt in, the finished product reflects your ""expressions and creativity"".

Some [articles](https://tech.yahoo.com/gaming/articles/arc-raiders-devs-don-t-150959107.html) are saying they DON'T use GenAI other than the AI Voices, *""AI text-to-speech is instead what Strandberg calls a ""studio strategy"" to punch above its weight. ""We are trying to maximize what we can, being a small team trying to get make rich worlds right, but still staying small... but we don't use generative AI in other domains across the game,"" he added.""*

But then [others](https://metro.co.uk/2025/10/30/arc-raiders-off-strong-start-pc-studio-defends-ai-voices-24573426/) are saying they DID use AI tools *""Strandberg also admits that other AI tools, such as machine learning, have been used for Arc Raiders’ development, though he insists that the technology will never outright replace anyone, while denying that generative AI was used to make any of the game’s content.""*

So what the hell was used? I mean besides the obvious AI voices, which are atrocious. How can you use Generative AI but then claim it's not in any of the games content, besides the ""voice acting"" which IS generative AI. If concept art, script, hell, even code is AI written, how can you claim that's ethical? And more importantly, why doesn't anyone care anymore? Are we just going to ignore the major issues with Generative AI, like most major models being built off of stolen artwork, or the major environmental impact?",True

The story is okay, but it's a somewhat disappointing campaign, I suppose. At the beginning, it does look very promising with interesting characters, the setting, and the plot, until it goes a bit stale during its climax and through to the end.  The overall gameplay loop was very fun, but it becomes more repetitive towards the end, and plus there's the lack of variety in splatterkills. The controls were a little bit stiff at times, especially during the platforming sections. The soundtrack is super great and fits very well during the fighting against enemies or bosses. The overall atmosphere is great and has its unique look to it, but it is definitely missing the eerie vibes from the original trilogy games. The three classic games included are a nice bonus.

Despite my thoughts on the remake, I'd still love to see a new remake of Splatterhouse, although Namco seems to have abandoned the Splatterhouse franchise after the mixed reception of the 2010 remake. I'm pretty sure that there is still a lot of potential stuff you can do with this series.",True

But here's the thing about generations - **each console generation is far shorter than anyone's childhood**. I had a Spectrum, an Amiga, a GBC, an N64 and a PS1 'as a kid' and when I first started uni and played shit loads of couch multiplayer I had at various time a GC, an Xbox and a PS2. When I was a young adult and living in a flatshare we had a Wii in the living room and used to have great party nights playing it. Any and all of the above inspire huge amounts of nostalgia for me.

And yet, if someone says the 6th gen (and the GC in particular seems to encourage this comment the most) was the best, there will almost certainly be people going: Oh, that's just nostalgia. But why would I have more nostalgia for gaming in my late teens/early twenties than in high school or even younger when friends would come round after class to play together. And for someone five years younger than me, why would it be vice versa?

Anyone who played games from a relatively young age will likely have at least three generations of consoles that they played in what will now be looked back on as nostalgia inducing times of their life. So nostalgia doesn't really explain anything other than that what's available now isn't their favourite (and or course, if anyone were to claim a current console was their favourite, well that would just be dismissed as ""recency bias"").

* **Attempts:** 3 per day per player; each attempt deals damage to Mekarion’s global HP.
* **Rewards if he dies in time:** all participants get an exclusive wand (**The Dreadmaw**).
* **Top contributors:** the 10 highest total damage dealers get **Mekarion’s flaming skull** as a permanent trophy.

**Why we built it**

  
We wanted HexWind to feel **alive -** events that respond to the community, not just patch notes. As a small team, we can try weird ideas fast. If this lands, we’ll keep going: more community raid bosses, asynchronous PvP events, and regular design/balance chats with players.

**Ask us anything about**

* Designing high-skill magic combat for VR (input mapping, readability, comfort).
* Building a roguelite that’s hard but fair.
* The tech behind a global boss in a single-player game (tracking, anti-cheese, data).
* Content cadence for a tiny team (what we cut, what we shipped, what we learned).
* The business side of indie VR (pricing, wishlists, store pages, and reality checks).
* Post-launch balance and how community feedback changes our roadmap.

We’ll be here **today** answering live for several hours and will check back later for stragglers. We’ll keep links to a minimum; if mods are OK with it, we’ll drop a single comment with optional community hubs for those who want to coordinate runs.

Thanks for reading and for supporting indie VR whether you play HexWind or just want to talk shop, we’re all ears.

1oizwwo,Review after around 20 hours in Outer Worlds 2,gaming,1761730150.0,689,0,False,"It's wild that Outer Worlds 2 has basically zero hype. The first Outer Worlds never really clicked with me, it sort of felt like a knockoff Fallout in a way, but TOW2 is clicking waaay more.

Playing on Xbox Series X and its suprisingly good looking and bug-free, especially considering I was playing it for review before the latest patches and early access. Playing on performance mode the most because it actually doesn't feel like much of a difference from quality or balanced (I did a bunch of screenshots to compare and they're honestly so similar). The smaller handcrafterd areas are great. There aren’t a gazillion empty planets to slog through like in Starfield, which honestly just makes me realise more and more that Starfield really should have gone the same way.

My memory is a bit rusty on the first game, but it basically feels like it does all the same things as the first game, just like... better. The gunplay’s fine, nothing special, but it feels good. Stealth is kinda janky, and I was bummed that hacking is just a skill thing with no mini-game. But where Outer Worlds 2 really surprised me is how much theyv'e stuck to the RPG side of things, it's not dummed down into a shooter, it's like a proper RPG, with lots of reading and talking and makes what skills you pick really feel like they matter. Could be good for replayablitlity.

I don't think this is going to be a GOTY contender or anything, but I’ve really been enjoying my time with it. Interested in hearing what fans of the first game think, since I wasn't.

**Edit for Quick Notes:** 

1. The first line about zero hype was actually speaking more to how Microsoft have barely made any major effort to market the game's release. Evident even in all the ""Oh is it out?"" comments (that said, its still valid that the first game didn't do much to inspire major excitement). 
2. Getting some flak for this, so I just want to be clear: No, this is not my full comprehensive review of the game, it's just a short casual post based on my review, around my experience with the game and to open the door for conversation in the comments.
3. Third point is an excuse to say that I hope you have fun and play awesome games that you love, ok bye.",True

I intentionally never save in an elevator. If I'm about to save and realize I'm in one, I purposefully step out. And I realized I've done that in every game with elevators for some time now.


The reason? Back when the OG Mass Effect came out, there was an awful bug where if you saved on an elevator and then loaded that save, you'd be stuck in the elevator forever with no way to escape. And if that was your only save, or only recent save, you were SOL.


I've never heard of that issue in any other game, but Mass Effect burned it into my head that you *do not* save in an elevator.

Before, it was very unlikely to get a throwing weapon kill, because it was hard enough to actually land one, and even if you did, it would basically never kill unless it was a sledgehammer or an ax to the chest or head. Now, they're all actually viable tactics, with the Pitchfork being the best because it throws and travels faster, and the shovel being the second best. But there's a lot of satisfaction from landing a thrown wood axe or the thunk of a sledgehammer.

Small changes, but they allow for something like this to be organized and it's so cool and I really wish I could play something like this.

People stop buying the game and the planned patch releases never go out due to funding crunch. 

Now if they release ads in-game they can make money out of it and continue supporting developers.

1oia8oq,How long should a hard section in a game last max?,gaming,1761660212.0,0,0,False,"So as someone who likes challenge in the games, sometimes they can be extremely annoying.

The final levels of Mario games usually offers a difficult level for instance but I never got frustrated or gave up. They are just the perfect instances of repeat the segments until you achieve. 

But I can't say the same things for NES games for example. Theoretically, they are the same logic, try until you achieve. But the biggest problem with this is the lack of saves. You just need to start over the whole game and the loss of progress just makes you lose motivation of progressing. Not to mention NES games takes around 2-3 hours usually which means a big loss considering this time is the average gametime for a day for most people! And hardest sections in NES games is almost always the last parts. So you need to play 2 hours to be able to practice that part only and obviously you fail and start all over as if you never played. And there are always more than one hard section in the game. 

When the loss of progression is 5-10 minutes when you fail, it doesn't seem to feel like you lose a progress and you practice and repeat until you achieve and you beat it, you feel like you accomplish it.

I hate the games when they limit saves for this reason the most. They try to give you a challenge with it but it only frustrates people since one mistake can cause you days of playing time. Not to mention you might not be able to put the game down when you want it to continue later.

How it works - Players are divided into 2 teams a prosecution and a defense.  1 player is the defendant, one player is the plaintiff, and the rest are witnesses.  The court is ruled by AI Snoop.  AI Snoop may be insane.  Snoop calls on people to give testimony or describe a scene and then renders his judgement.  It rarely makes scene but really, I'm not playing to win, I'm playing for insanity.  

The game starts with everyone just telling a story about themselves.  It doesn't have to do with anything.  Tell a dumb story.  After everyone tells a story Snoop picks out a few things and makes a case out of it.  I'm pretty sure the case will be a dumb civil matter, any mention of murder is ignored I think.  

So our cases -

The plaintiff was suing because the organizer of the donkey race he was part of used Disposable plates that weren't eco friendly.  The defense made the case that the plates were made of compressed hay and that the donkeys ate them after but Snoop didn't buy it.  Later the idea of Donkey races being a Mexican tradition came up but snoop ruled that environmentalism was better than tradition.

The second Case crashed before we really got into it

The Third case (our first with 4) was that the defendant ate all the Shrek popsicles that were used to prepare the donkeys before the big donkey race.  Snoop enjoyed and believed the expert testimony that Donkeys run faster after eating Shrek popsicle, but then the game crashed.  

The final case was that the defendant owned a pirate themed cruise ship and didn't pay the defendant their full wages because they shorted the company on an order of lemons.  That was the case Snoop came up with, don't ask me.  Snoop didn't seem to care about invoices, scurvy, the use of oranges in place of lemons or any argument.  The plaintiff won, even though the pirate crew got scurvy.  A travesty of justice.

In some cases you are asked to describe a scene and then some AI art of what you described pops up as evidence.  The quality of the pictures is poor.  The accuracy of the picture is extremely poor.  The pictures look like an absurd fever dream and they always made us laugh at the insanity of it all.

Overall, this isn't a game, it's a really shitty AI that spews nonsense and it's hilarious.  Nothing matter, Snoop is insane, the AI art is absurd, the whole whing is a wild ride that rarely makes sense, often crashes, but yet, I love it and want to play again.  Also it's the rare Jackbox style game that works great with just 2 people.  

If you have Prime and a friend you really need to try it.

1ohlgol,A love letter to Assetto Corsa,gaming,1761587732.0,44,0,False,"It's still a fling and not true love perhaps, but anyway, long ramble incoming:

When I bought my wheel last year, there was only one game I really had in mind: Dirt Rally 2. I also got Project Cars 2 and Assetto Corsa, the latter kind of as an afterthought, thinking it would be quite boring. 

Fast forward a tumultuous year, and I haven't got to spend much time with it yet. I finally got a bit of breathing room and enough motivation to set up the wheel again, and I arrive at one conclusion: I suck at rally. It's enjoyable, yes, but it leaves me exhausted, and I crash more often than anything. 

Project Cars never quite hooked me. In part it was probably due to the game acting weirdly with my wheel. That aside, it never really got me interested for some reason. 

So here I was, low key regretting my purchase, when I decided to fire up Assetto Corsa for the first time, because why not? 

This here was a game that loaded up without much fanfare. It didn't fight with my wheel. It gave me a simple uncluttered menu with an option for quick race directly available. 

I came to yet another conclusion: I suck at driving on tracks too. But boy, this is fun! 

Driving in this game is simply *fun* in a way I can't describe. It feels satisfying to take corners with the wheel. After a couple of graphical mods, it looks brilliant too. There's even a little career mode. The AI is ridiculous, but who needs AI when driving around an empty track is this fun? 

This is a game that lets me drive around in all the cars I could want. I inevitably go off track but it's less annoying than in rally. There's always the desire to improve when I look at hotlaps and find how laughably abysmal my time is compared to the best times. 

And, there are mods. I spent some time modding in the Shutoko Expressway and other free roam maps like Targa Florio. I can now drive around to my heart's content looking at the scenery, simply lost in the pleasure of driving. 

It's been a long time since a game made me feel like this. It brings back childhood memories of when I used to spend countless hours flying around in modded airplanes in Microsoft Flight Simulator X. My adult self hasn't experienced anything close to this. 

For all I know this will fizzle out. I'll grow tired of driving and move on to other games. But this discovery is something I'll cherish, and from time to time, I'll pop back in for a relaxed drive around the Nürburgring in a simple car. ",True

I completely understand that people enjoy different playstyles and have varying amounts of free time. However, I’ve noticed a growing trend on Reddit that I find quite interesting — and a little concerning — when it comes to how quickly players consume games today.

Across various gaming subreddits, I often see posts almost immediately after a game’s release asking about downloadable content, expansions, or New Game+ modes. It feels as though many players rush through the base game so fast that they’re already looking ahead for something more before others have even finished the main story.

This year, for example, I’ve been playing *Kingdom Come: Deliverance II*, *Ghosts of Yotei*, *Ball X Pit*, and the usual *FIFA* sessions with friends. In each of those communities, I’ve seen countless threads along the lines of “Where’s the DLC?”, “When is New Game+ coming?”, or “I’ve already max-leveled my character.” Meanwhile, I’m still working my way through the main storyline, far from 100% completion.

I usually play for about one to two hours most evenings, which I think puts me in the range of an average player. Yet it sometimes feels like the gaming world moves at a completely different pace — one where people finish massive, content-rich games within days and are immediately eager for more.

It’s not a complaint, exactly — just an observation about how gaming habits have evolved. With the abundance of content and constant updates in modern games, it seems many players are less inclined to savor the experience and more focused on what’s next.

1og1sy4,Soul Calibur III - A remembrance and a lament,gaming,1761424171.0,39,0,False,"Today marks the 20th anniversary of the release of Soul Calibur III.  I still remember going to the video store to rent it.  It was raining that day and a bit foggy, perfect day to be inside a playing a video game.  My mother asked me what game I rented and I told her saying that it was ""kind of like The Three Musketeers"", which my mom would have known from the movie with Gene Kelly and Lana Turner.  Except The Three Musketeers didn't have a samurai, a lady wearing next to nothing wielding a chain whip sword, lizardmen, a couple of eldritch abominations, and is actually set 30 years prior to the events of Alexander Dumas' story.

I liked that challenge the game gave you in having to go through multiple playthroughs to unlock all the characters.  I even had a strategy guide that had all the characters moves and I mean all of them.  Big, huge thing it was.  Only thing it lacked was a guide for each character's path to fighting Night Terror.  And when I did encounter that thing, it would more often than not wipe the floor with me like I was a janitor's push broom.  But you would get a good amount of in game money to spend if you beat him.

And then there's the voice cast - Crispin Freeman, Eden Riegel, Kari Wahlgren, Keith Silverstein.  A very solid voice acting cast.  

That brings me to the next and best feature the game had - create a Soul.  The first of the series to have it.  You could buy armor and clothing and things to make your own fighter.  Yeah, you actually had to purchase your equipment to make your character and what you equipped you character with effected how well their offence and defense was in battle.  This wasn't just a cosmetic thing.

Tied to create a Soul was Soul Calibur III's second best feature - an original story not connected to our world.  You created your character from a set of classes and the higher your original character got in level, another character class would be unlocked, and the higher level two classes other classes got you would unlock the highest class levels.  Also, these levels came with their own class of weapons that the main Soul Calibur cast couldn't use like grieves and battle fans and tambourines.

And that's where the lament comes in.  Soul Calibur III was as far as they could have gone with the main cast.  The story mode being set in a fictional fantasy world is where they should have gone for the sequels.  They could have done so much more with that.  They could have still had the main fighters but they would come from made up countries on a made up world.  But, no, we still had to be set on Earth with cheap as characters like Hilde easily able to do ""ring outs"".

So, sales and quality for the series declined.  And with Team Soul disbanded, it looks like the six Soul Calibur will be the last, the characters sent off to the Namco Vault, which in my mind is a combo of The Disney Vault, a Vault from Fallout with the evil experiments, and the Island of Misfit Toys from Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.  A depressing thought, but a sad reality.  I did say there was a lament.  Now the only Souls games Bandai Namco releases are ones where you really need to be good at dodging and timing or you'll die easily.

Tl:dr Soul Calibur III was great and the series is very much missed.  A lot of potential unrealized causing it to get to get stuck in a rut along with guest characters that weren't needed nor were a big draw brought the series to its end...for now.",True

1oea25i,Are classic style games unpopular with gamers or just devs?,gaming,1761241760.0,0,0,False,"I've been looking into a lot of newer games and I've noticed everything has pretty much been streamlined into the same ""modernized""  experience. Even popular classic franchises have abandoned their roots and made some attempt to reinvent themselves which has led to their original niche disappearing from the current market entirely. 

Shooters:

Arena - Halo I think would be a good example to start with. I feel like all shooters these have become always exclusively tactical shooters geared towards a competitive experience. I had a lot of trouble articulating exactly how Halo dropped for me until I started replaying old 90's arena shooters like Quake, Doom, and Marathon and experienced some of that old magic. I began to realize that Halo 3 was the last holdout of the classic era of arena shooter, and that Halo 3 had more in common with Quake II than it does Halo Infinite. I can't remember where it came from but I do remember seeing an ad that said ""We're not making your dad's shooter"" and it's almost like there's a disdain there in the gaming industry for the classics. 

Light Gun/Rail Shooters - I see a few of these get made for VR and Arcades exclusively but I almost never see them for home console releases. I think the Wii was the last console to really represent this game type, but I have a lot of fond memories of Light Gun games Judge Dredd, Star Fox, Star X! Light Gun games have always had trouble hitting home media and it's sad to see that hasn't changed much. Gundam: Final Shooting, Jurassic Park, the Star Wars Trilogy, and more recently Halo Fireteam Raven were all pretty good and unfortunately live and die with the accessibility of local arcades.  I think Light Gun games are even more fun for couch co-op than other shooter genres because you don't have to split screens for multiplayer. 

RPGs/Side Scrollers:

RPGs - The core issue with the modernization of these games is they've all become 3D. Pokemon as an example had a chibi overworld artstyle that really couldn't be replicated well in 3D, but there's also the cost increase of making a 3D game tanking the quality of the game itself. A lot of the features older games offered freely like Battle Tower/Frontiers and Safari Zones are removed and repackaged as DLC. There's even fewer games being made per generation. I hear a lot of people even today say Emerald was one of the best Pokemon games out there with only Platinum possibly rivaling it. I feel like staying largely 2D might've been a better move for the franchise both aesthetically and for the overall quality of the product.

Side Scrollers - I believe it was games like Mario, Zelda, and Sonic that popularized this medium, but I gravitated more towards Castlevania and Alien Hominid. These games definitely have a charm of their own that I can't really describe, but I do miss the genre, and honestly the bits as well. Bit art was always something that was very appealing to me.

I think the devs in the current game industry have ultimately moved past old genres for the sake of trend chasing and technical progress, and I don't think they considered if gamers have really had enough of these old genres. I know I haven't at least.

Edit: Indie isn't really an answer for why mainstream devs aren't making classic style games. Indie Devs are the underground, grassroots studios. Their work isn't always accessible to every gamer, and the vast majority of indie games aren't console compatible. Consider more than just the PC gamer",True

40% of Steam games (over 5,000 games) failed to recoup $100 (which is the fee required to put your game in Valve's Steam store).

Over 8,000 (8,388 or 65.9% of 2025 releases) games are estimated to have earned under $1,000 (which is NOTHING, especially if they have employees, even if this is one developer, they can't live off of $1,000/year whether in the US or even a developing country)

47.4% are estimated to have sold under 100 copies, with 28% estimated between 100 and 1,000 copies.

8% of the releases are estimated to have grossed over $100,000.

The bottom 30% of games by revenue averaged just $37 in apparent gross.

Many co-op games emphasize the skills of singular players, but others like the ones in the title, found a way to make the act of collaboration a skill in itself.

It could be a name such as Voltron-likes, or Megazorg-likes, where two (or more) players take control of a single entity.

1odunzw,Current State of Consoles,gaming,1761196048.0,0,0,False,"I think this really shows something about the state of gaming currently, especially about the current crop of console games. I know there was the whole covid pandemic at the start of this generation, but I don't think it fully accounts for what we are seeing here.

PlayStation 4 released Christmas 2013 and the PlayStation 5 released Christmas 2020. So we can say roughly the PS4 had 7 years of it being the big Sony offering and main platform out in the wild.

If you look at the list of best selling PS4 games; Spideman sold 22.7 million, God or War was 21 mil, Horizon Zero Dawn 19.3 mil, Uncharted 4 18.6 mil, The Last of Us 18.6 mil. Those are all Sony Interactive Entertainment games. Other games on the best selling list that aren't Sony produced or cross platform titles like COD BO3 15 mil and COD MW 13.6 mil, Red Dead Redemption 2 14 mil, Witcher 3 10.8 mil, Bloodborne 7.6 mil. 

Now look at the list of PS5 games. Number 1 is Spiderman 2 (which was also a pack in game for a bit), it sold 11 million. Number 2 is Black Myth Wukong at 5 mil and then Ratchet & Clank Rift Apart at 4 mil. Fourth place is Elden Ring at 3.7 mil and rounding out the top 5 is Final Fantasy XVI at 3 mil.

The PS5 is just about to celebrate 5 years on the market. That is over 70% of what we called the PS4's lifetime. PS5s top selling game would be the 13th best selling game on PS4's list. PS5's second highest selling game would be 28th on PS4's. PS5's third would be PS4's 33rd. And it just goes way down from there.

True PS5 has sold 80 million units against the PS4's 113 million and still has 2 years left. But the sales difference of about 30 million consoles doesn't justify how little PS5 software has sold.

The other difference is the names. All those big selling PS4 games are IPs that defined that generation or the ones before. IPs that are etched into history as some of the biggest franchises in all of gaming. I would struggle really coming up with much if you asked me to say which games I thought defined the PS5 as a platform or the 2020s as a whole. There have been no new franchises that have launched on PS5 and become a sensation or title that people NEED to buy a PS5 for. Obviously this could change and new games could come out and explode in sales over the next 2 years, but I doubt it.

Is it the costs and complexity of new hardware that is preventing huge selling memorable games? Does it just take too long and be too much of an investment on the current level of technology? Are people losing interest in console games or games in general? How does this bode for the next generation of hardware like a PS6 that we might start hearing details of soon if the 7 year per generation rule holds that is bound to be more expensive and complicated?",True

However, I haven't been able to find an artwork that's higher quality than the one I linked, barring any fan-arts or touched up with watermarks.

Failing that, I could use some inspiration and wanted to know which sites people go to for the highest quality videogame artwork, specifically anything Nintendo-related in this case.

For you number rating people have a 9.11037/10. My GOTY.

This review contains minor spoilers (route names, minor plot details).


**Prelude:**

The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy - is a Visual Novel*/SRPG*. It’s a game by Tookyo Games, a new small studio created by Danganronpa creator Kazutaka Kodaka and Zero Escape/AITSF creator Kotaro Uchikoshi, two legends in the Adventure VN world. This game promised to feature 100 endings that appear based on choices you made during the story. It would combine the elements of Despair inducing events from Danganronpa and Extreme Scenarios from Zero Escape with its tagline ""Extreme X Despair"". The game almost threw the studio into bankruptcy, and the studio’s survival depended on the game’s success. 

I don't want to say the game is a ""hidden gem"", as it has a niche audience, but it has not been one of the prominent releases this year. The game released the same day as the critically acclaimed game Clair Obscur - Expedition 33. While both games are RPGs, they didn't have much audience overlap. The developers did advertise each other online, so that probably canceled out any possible negative effects. Currently few major review outlets have reviewed it, but it is sitting at a nice 84 on Metacritic and won the Excellence Award at the Japan Game Awards.

I personally played the game day one as I am a pretty big fan of Danganronpa's mysteries and the, frankly, craziness of the creator. The things that happen in those games you won't find anywhere else. The charm continued into his spiritual successor Master Detective Archives: Raincode, and while the mysteries weren't as well done, I loved the characters and world. I was excited for his next game that was a collaboration with the creator of another series I liked with Zero Escape, although at the time I only played 999.

Onto the game review

**Positives:**

Story:

Wildly inconsistent, but some routes have the most brilliant writing l've seen from some of these writers. Those routes make this game my GOTY. The Sci-Fi explanations, mysteries unraveled, history learned, psychological breaks, and character interactions are all so entertaining. Can't go into much detail without spoiling though.

The routes span so many genres so it's hard to get bored of the story itself. Sci Fi, Mystery, Comedy, Romance, Horror, Teenage Dream. It was surprising how many types of stories they fit into one game. I wish they went even wilder (where's my musical route).

Cast:

Main: 

The whole cast, like is normal for Kodaka games, is a bunch of exaggerated tropes. The gang biker, the mechanic, the rich girl, the guy with a negative amount of ego, etc. Then they are given something to make them a little more complex, and these are revealed and deepened through your time with them. There's the Monokuma like mascot Sirei, who is probably the most interesting mascot in a Kodaka game, and I really enjoyed his screentime (and his music too). The one character I have to congratulate the most though is the main character, Takumi Sumino. He has to go through so many different scenarios, and he adapts to all of them well. He isn't some blank slate self insert, he's an actual character. Is he the most unique? No, he's the straight man and ""normal guy"", but he is a character with complex morals and understandable reasoning. Seeing how his psyche is challenged in the routes is really entertaining.

Villains: 

The Supreme Commander of the Invaders >!V'ehxness!<, in the >!Route 0, V'ehxess and 2nd Scenario!< routes specifically, may be the best villain of the year. Her presence is undeniable, her dialogue is amazing, and she is a threat to the party. She also does a lot of
""aura farming"", her transformation sequences being super cool no matter how often I see them. Also I just love her design.

The Invaders having their own functional language is cool, reminding me of Lies of P and Nier. 

Other major villains are amazing but are too spoilery to go into detail on here. 


Gameplay:

The strategy gameplay is pretty fun when you first start. A game where it's beneficial to kill your units? Interesting. Learning how to absolutely burn a boss as much as you can in one turn is awesome. New units joining adding new strategies to utilize too.

Art:

 This game boasts over 2000 full body sprites and around 600 CGs (unique scenes) which is a ton. Most of them look really good, although the Switch did pixilate them a bit on the larger ones.

Voice Acting:

 I personally played the dub. Sparse as it is, it is extremely entertaining. Whenever battles occurred it was something I looked forward to as voice acting was guaranteed in that case. The VAs gave so much personality to everyone. Takumi’s, Kurara’s, Tsubasa’s, Sirei’s, and The Supreme Commander’s being the ones that stand out the most to me.

Music:

Unsurprisingly good. It sounds exactly like how Danganronpa did, with some more “rock fantasy” style tracks for battles. There’s also some music that knocked by socks off that played for special occasions. 


**Negatives:**

Note a lot of these only appeared to me after 120 or so hours.

Story:

Wildly inconsistent. There are routes that seemingly have no reason for existing other than just to waste your time as they have such little payoff.

A lot of loose ends. Most routes have their own continuity and rules, which is fine, but sometimes they are inconsistent in their own routes. Things are introduced and never resolved since they only exist in that route.

There is an issue with the 100 Day format.
Most routes try to stretch their short stories out to 100 days even though they really don't need to be. This leads to a lot of days being any of the following: Free Time (Persona but less stuff), pointless explorations, or getting dribbles of plot over days that could've been said in one scene. One of the biggest examples of this is the >!Comedy Route!<, which is over 100 days long. This is because it splits at multiple points, and these splits also go 100 days, adding a ton of free time days and making the endings (basically one running gag) go on for far too long. They could've easily compressed all of these bits into one 100 day line and made it way more dense and enjoyable.

Battles are always on the same day. There's never any tension of ""what if the enemies attack today"". The player knows exactly what day they will attack and who after their first ending. The characters may not know, but the player does.

Writing style inconsistencies. Routes were written by a bunch of different people. So not only does the style of writing change but also the characterizations and plot structure. This can be jarring sometimes. Uchikoshi’s unique writing style did not shine through much, even on the routes he personally wrote. That kinda disappointed me there.


Cast:

Main: 

Not many issues. If I had one l'd say it's that character development constantly gets reset as you do every run, and not every character gets development in a route (rarely more than 3 beyond Takumi in one route). Some characters like the Tsukumo Twins desperately needed a route to show some growth and emotional strength, but they never really got any.

Villains: 

The Supreme Commander is a laughing stock in a good amount of routes, sometimes on purpose sometimes not. I said she was amazing in some, like best villain of the year, but there's a lot where she is irrelevant. The other Commanders are barely characters and more just faceless monsters beyond one specific route, which I guess an argument could be made that it showed the game's theming to the inhumanity of war, but I just found it boring.


Gameplay:

Nearly every route has the same exact battles on the same exact day, barring some missing units. Making battles extremely repetitive and predictable. While you can skip them if you've done them before, it doesn't make me want to play it. Reaching a point fairly quickly where the game becomes a pure VN as you don't do any SRPG battles anymore (why I italicized SRPG). It's also extremely easy after your first ending, you being able to one turn most waves. The new difficulty that makes it so you get one shot just makes it take a turn longer maybe, not much more difficult.

The exploration minigame is flat out boring.
Mario Party without any fun. You aren't forced to do it often, but when you are IT SUCKS. Just hoping you get high rolls to go faster but not land on an enemy space that won't challenge you but just slow you down. I don't think I ever once volunteered to explore for materials.

Exploring the school isn't very fun in its 2d state, and there's not much to click on for flavor text (a trademark of Uchikoshi games). I found myself just teleporting to every room even within the first route. If it was 3d like Danganronpa I feel it would be more fun to traverse.

Art: 

Lack of environments. You really are at the school 99% of the time likely in the Cafeteria, War Room, or Takumi’s Room. If you are off campus it’s likely one of 5 places and that is extremely rare. The few routes where you spend meaningful time off campus are honestly so refreshing.

A lot of the CGs are clearly outsourced. Some look weird and have inconsistencies with the rest of the game. Artstyle occasionally changes too.

**Tips:**

If you want to play only the amazing stuff and avoid as much as the subpar stuff as possible, I recommend these guides (route name spoilers)

1. >!Route 0->2nd Scenario!< (only doing these makes the game a succinct 60-70 hour long game with good pacing and character development with an amazing ending)

If you want more:

2. >!Slasher, Box of Calamity, Coming of Age, Retsnom, Killing Game, and Mystery -> SF!< (basically every good long route) 

Short stories but really good:

3. >!V’ehxness, Multiple Eitos, and Goodbye Eito!<.

Then play the rest of the routes as you want. Whatever you do DO NOT play the >!Comedy!< route first, it is not worth it. 


**My Takeaway:**

This game is extremely special. There is nothing like it. I can try to analogize it to if you went to a steakhouse and ordered 100 steaks for the price of 1: 30 were bad and immediately thrown out, 50 were fine/good but a bit tough, but 20 were absolutely amazing. Is it worth the price? Absolutely. Is it worth the time to eat all 100? Not for everyone. But what if you could take the steaks home and eat them as you like. It took me until after I took a 4 month break from the game after I burnt out to realize this. I missed the story and characters. Lucky me, I had another 20 hours with them. This made me realize how the creators likely intended the game to be played, as a story you can always return to and experience something new. You make your choices running through a story with this cast, and at the end you reflect ""is this the ending I want?"", if not you keep playing, however if it is you just stop. The game truly isn't meant to be a sprint, but a marathon.

One day the game will draw you back, and you'll have a couple **hundred** of hours of stories to experience with these characters.

You say you ""enjoyed the core gameplay loop"" did you yeah? If what you're talking about was specifically the gameplay loop. That specifically designed, looping repetitive system?

Now let's say you're talking about...metal gear solid 3. You ""enjoyed the core gameplay loop"" did you? What loop? There is none in either a macro or micro scale. There is no looping concepts or factors in that linear story based game, either opaquely speaking or even in a more hidden sense. You can just say that you enjoyed the gameplay. The word ""loop"" need not be involved. Even if you try and conceptualise it and break the game down into needlessly applied game design terms that you're not actually referring to, there isn't really a loop. Going to a new area and then stealthing through to get to the next area, isn't a loop.  

Stop being so keen to consciously or otherwise, reduce all video games to some kind of attention-farming process that simply repeats itself ad infinitum. Stop talking in game design terms that do not necessarily apply just because your favourite reviewers have all inexplicably started using them in the past 5 years and you want to parrot what they say to sound more in-the-know.

I have always interpreted the concept of being able to choose your conversational and character responses as a type of ownership, of your path through the narrative and of your Geralt, Adam Jensen and Shepard.   
  
But I find that ownership is destroyed when a sequel is explicit in going down a path you didn't choose in a previous game.

A Deus Ex example is in Human Revolution It ends with you having the ability to choose to tell the world the truth of what happened, Blame an opposition group, join the Illuminate, or blow up a thing and let things land where they land. (I am being intentionally vague to avoid spoilers).

The sequel decides what choice you made, and if you picked different from what the dev's decided, This isn't your story anymore. It defines the choice you made previously as wrong, or fanfiction in a way.

Witcher is going to do something similar, with 4. The ending of 3 is basically about your character's choices inspiring what kind of woman Ciri she will become (Those choices where very easy to misinterpret at the time though). 

But Witcher 4 will set in stone the cannon of that world is, and again if you didn't choose for her to >!become a witcher!<, then your previous choice becomes invalid.

I know in a practical sense, those choices have to be made. Witcher 4 would be a Civ game if you choose the other ending to canonize, But I think then greater care should be made when offering the initial choice that could define the sequel.

Character creation has real impact on the story. You clan choice especially chooses which abilities you have to complement your guns/melee. There’s standard clans, but then You can also be a Malkavian, who are gifted with divine foresight which has driven them clinically insane, and it completely rewrites all player dialogue similar to a Fallout low intelligence run, but you’re insane instead. Or be a Nosferatu, who are literally just a walking corpse, who’s mere appearance is so obviously supernatural, even being seen in public is a masquerade violation. You cannot meet contact in public, and instead are in a permanent stealth playthrough. You can have at least 3 completely unique playthroughs of the game. There is so much world reactivity.

In The Last of Us, there is a calm walk after a hard scene. No fight. No music telling me what to feel. Only footsteps and the wind. I set the controller down and let the silence do the work. It felt honest.

1obqejq,Piecing together the secret formula for Star Citizen.,gaming,1760986792.0,0,0,False,"This is something that I never see brought up, but should be brought up more often.

Star Citizen is a controversial and struggling project from CIG games. It is currently a buggy and bad game. People claim its a scam, and they're right, but it is also a game, a bad game, but a game with promise. Yeah, they fleeced people for way too much money for the game. Yes, lies were told, but... there is this not totally terrible game that has resulted from the project which you can play.

But its time to look at the game actually being built, as opposed to pie in the sky bullshit that usually surrounds the game.

Star Citizen is a full loot sandbox game. It has as much in common with Rust as it does with Eve Online. It is perhaps the most promising full loot project currently in development. This is partly because most devs sadly don't touch full loot gaming with a 10 foot pole (devs - and especially the funders of development are cowards), but is also because Star Citizen has some pretty damn impressive tech behind it at this point. Ships in ships, large universe, seamless transitions between planets and now a high population cap.

It looks like Star Citizen is gearing up to be about faction infighting.

**Faction infighting**

Star Ctiizen has a bunch of land vehicles, that appear to be totally useless to the game. They've been in the game for a while, but there's no reason to actually use them. Its  a spaceship game after all, so why use a tank when you can use a Starfighter or gigantic flying gunship to attack an enemy position from the air? Well, it looks like the reason is gonna be shields.

Star Citizen is adding base building, and the key to it seems to be the presence of large dome like shields that protect an area from attack from the air. Some of these shields are even said to be completely invulnerable  - and cannot be broken from the air, so how do you attack anyway? The answer is likely to be the constellation of ground vehicles that have been in the game for years with no real use.

**Base raiding**

Star Citizen is getting bases, and they need giant shields to protect them, so it stands to reason that we're also getting base raiding. Players will be able to explore a planet, and set up bases in various territories on its surface. You can put up your own giant shield which is difficult to break, and do your thing.

If someone wants to attack your base without declaring war by attacking your shield, they'll have to put down vehicles on the surface outside of your shield, and drive them in. This is a really interesting system for building a PVP end game. You invest in a location, pour resources into it, and try to extract as much as you can before another group notices it and decides to destroy it. You can then try to defend it for as long as possible, or just put down another base elsewhere and start over. This process should generate immense wealth over time - especially if you're putting down bases in lucrative low security space and providing your own defense. Its an engine for never-ending fun content. Its Rust, but in space, with Space Ships. Instead of wiping the server, bases get wiped individually. The world of Star Citizen is so large that it should take time for enemy corps to find your bases in the game world, time enough to maybe turn a profit before your sandcastle is kicked over and you have to start again.

**Conclusion**

Everything I wrote is just supposition. Its based in fact. The game does feature ground vehicles, they are adding bases, but the notion that this is intended to be the game's primary PVP content generation loop is  my own personal belief. It IS enough, a loop like that where explorers search for bases, and builders try to mine out resources before they're found, and pirate and rival orgs wage war on existing bases to loot what they can... that's a good god damn loop for a full game. Its the kind of loop that could ensure such a game's success, despite its rocky start and bad reputation.

Most of what is necessary for this loop currently exists in some form. You have transport ships to move goods to and from bases. You have combat ships to wage war over a base. You have ground vehicles to raid them, mining ships to mine the surrounding area, scanning ships to find such bases and resources that indicate that a base should be placed down.

All that's really missing are the bases themselves.

CIG tries to sell the game as everything to everyone, but I think that's stupid. What they're planning in the short term is pretty damn good. I think they should lean into what they intend to actually deliver in the near term, because I think that what they intend to deliver sounds better than the vague ""simulation"" bullshit that is usually marketed. Its why despite the scam-y nature of its development, I still keep an eye on the game.

They're getting close to something really impressive - maybe.",True

I can absolutely see and appreciate the insane advancements we've made since then (ray tracing, 4K textures, etc.), but honestly, anything beyond the fidelity of Crysis is just a bonus.

1obbwix,why dont more free 2 play games have level progression mechanics?,gaming,1760938879.0,0,0,False,"best examples: COD Warzone/COD Mobile , Splitgate 2, Destiny 2

while i appreciate games such as Fortnite, Apex Legends, and Marvel Rivals, i just cant play them for long without that dreaded feeling of ""this is fun and all, but what really is the point of playing this, other than fun?"" because thats honestly really what i feel the sole purpose of those games are, and nothing else. youre probably gonna say ""well no shit, thats what video games are primarily created for"". and youre 1000% correct! however, its also totally reasonable to want just a little more from video games, which is why there are hundreds of genres,sub genres, and overall thousands of games to choose from anyway.

but going back to the topic at hand, and the games in question, what completely negative reasons are there for having level progression in said games, if there are any? in Fortnite and Apex legends, why arent we able to level our guns up and unlock attachments, like in Warzone and Splitgate 2? or why not add a seperate game mode for this? in Marvel Rivals, unless im 100% incorrect(since i havent fully played the game since like january), why doesnt each character have their own Level progression(or since its 2025, a character specific ""battle pass"" thats FREE maybe?). where we level up and unlock new skins,or new abilities? something along those lines.

i just personally feel adding such mechanics would really add a lot more (replay) value to the games. and again, the examples of Warzone and SG2 were used because those games are completely free 2 play AND include the mechanics in question, and it WORKS great. im able to play those games, work on leveling up my guns, unlock camos for those guns, unlock calling cards, emblems, etc. i just wish more games had such mechanics. instead, at the end of the day, they really just serve the purpose of entertainment, and entertainment only, and it really makes me feel they could be so much more than that. its like the only way to get anything close to what WZ and SG2 does, is via a battlepass

1ob9ri7,Star Citizen and the weenie problem.,gaming,1760931894.0,0,0,False,"  
  
Star Citizen as a project has a lot of issues, and everyone knows about the ones involving development. 

But there are deeper problems with CIG's forever project. Frankly, its userbase. 

It doesn't understand what kind of game CIG is making. 

Star Citizen is a full loot game. You can shoot other players, and take their stuff. You can shoot up their ships, and take their stuff. It hails from a long line of masterpieces, from Ultima Online to Rust to Eve Online and Albion. This type of game is popular, and the formula works. 

But CIG didn't tell their backers that this is what they're doing. 

So people have been backing Star Citizen for over a decade now, without really understanding what kind of game they're backing. 

Star Citizen has more in common with Rust than tranditional MMORPGs. The game that it most closely resembles is either Albion Online or Eve Online, but the people that bought Eve and Albion understood what they were getting into, and for the most part, the Star Citizen userbase doesn't. 

They genuinely believe that they're supposed to be playing some kind of Destiny in Space rather than Rust in Space. They think they're getting a themepark on rails when they're really getting a survival sandbox.

And this is problematic. 

First its problematic because CIG should have been more upfront with them than they were. CIG has a long track record of trying to be all things to all people, and they want to sell ships, so they've been playing down the anti-social aspects of their game. They haven't been as up front about it as they should have been. Star Citizen is designed to allow other players to take your shit. Its designed to have them find you, blow you ship up, and take your hard earned loot. These people, are understandably upset. 

And its also problematic because these people are trying to ruin the game. 

Because Star Citizen would be the best game it can be as a full loot survival MMO. CIG has a good vision for the game. Bases and base raids, with land vehicles and shields, fleet battles... all that makes sense in a full loot environment. Full loot makes the battles matter, keeps things high stakes, adds to the game's tension. It injects thrill into the game when you successfully haul your goods getting past that gank squad. It gives you a reason to improve as a pilot, so that you can enjoy the spoils of victory. It is good for the game.   
  
But the community does not believe this. The community is in denial about there being a long history of successful full loot games, from Rust to Albion. It continually fights to ""weeniefy"" Star Citizen.  

And the game has enough problems, god knows the game has enough problems, without a large contingent of its fans looking to pull a ""New World"" and have the game dump its original vision midway through development. 

I feel for Star Citizen's weenies. I get that Star Citizen's true nature wasn't explained well enough to them. It was explained, CIG has from the start said that Star Citizen would feature piracy... but I think that CIG kind of let people go on thinking that it was going to be whatever the fans wanted it to be... and that isn't right when you're talking about a full loot game. 

So while I have sympathy, I also hope that the weenies don't get their way. They will ruin Star Citizen as New World was ruined. And we all know the project doesn't need any more monumental challenges. ",True

You do not get to market yourself and bring in revenue based on a name, make something so radically different, and then complain when you fail to meet the expectations you set for yourself. You can’t have your cake and eat it too. 

This was not the sequel fans were waiting for. While the game may have redeeming qualities on its own merits, that doesn’t invalidate what is a very reasonable criticism. 

We went from fighting shark people, investigating a serial killer, stopping a plague, Jamaican Surgeons, and so many individually hand crafted side stories to 3 copy-pasted side quests archetypes. 

You cannot strip away character creation, multiple approaches to quests, stats/stat checks, equipable weapons, humanity, discard the iconic main theme, lean less into Goth and more into Noir, and then be surprised when people are disappointed. The game is barely even an RPG. 

Will the sequel be solid on its own merits? Maybe. Starfield isn’t a bad game at all. It’s just a disappointment.

It's Lee Petty's best work yet. It's a scape of environments, concepts, feelings, meaning, sound, that you traverse organically. There is no HUD, there is no score, there is no combat, there is nothing that can detract from the lush, richly imagined world that you wander through guided by mere curiosity and wonder.

Visually, it looks like the sort of beautiful game concept art you may have seen long before a game release usually looking nothing like the final product, even if the final product is beautiful.l, because a game cannot hope to match it. In Keeper's case, it's like the concept art came to life and *is* the product. This game, and I am not exaggerating, is like a painting almost every single frame of the way. I can't even name you a game that is this beautiful in terms of flawless execution on art direction. You'll come across very many exquisite shots that are sublime compositions. Anu of which you can just take a still of and hang on a wall in your house. Nothing is jarring, out of place, ugly or aesthetically weird looking.

It's filled to the brim with a very rich palette of colors that is such a feast to the eye you might start suspecting you spontaneously contracted tetrachromacy. Its painterly quality reminded me of one of my favorite movies ""What Dreams May Come"".. there are many moments in the game where you could swear you're looking at actual paint in a subtle yet visceral way I've not seen in any other game, even ones that are supremely artful like Shadow of The Colossus or Journey, nor ganes thst introduced actual brush strokes like Okami.

The sound design is special in that the sound is masterfully interwoven with its evolving beauty. You just have to experience it to feel it. A lot of the time the music is in the soundscape mixed in with the pace at which you do things, ambient sounds and other sound FX mixed into it all. There is just a rhythm and cadence to the game that underscores everything where it can be seen almost like a musical composition. It's hard to put into words, but it's very clear great effort went into creating a world where the player naturally explores and discovers, while beautifully conducting along the way.

Keeper is an interactive reel of stunning continuous shots that feel endless as you explore curious puzzles and an ever-branching environment.

**Shatterline** \- Interesting hero shooter, had a working story line, world building. Gun play was fresh, story was interesting, it had a partial campaign, PVP and an extraction PVE mode. Game could have been huge with more content (i.e completed campaign, weapon customizations)

**Robocraft** \- 3rd person robot vehicle shooter, you made your own robot block by block then piloted it, fighting other players. Unique building mechanics made for a fun and creative PVP game, was one a kind in the sense you had a lot of freedom to make your own bots and how they could fight (i.e hover crafts, flying sniper planes, a moving block with cannons, pixel art with machine guns).

But devs keep chasing trends, each update made huge changes nobody like, they added lootbox, let you buy designs from other players for premium currency, and made a lot of updates that removed the creative block building.

Eventually the devs alienated its own player base, they tried to make a sequel but it was also bad. Start of the year the studio closed down and now this game is gone forever.

Especially since the game is ALL on the disc, besides patches, which, on PS5 (they may on Xbox too, I don't know), you can play games without updates.

I wrote an entire post on the BF6 sub on how there's really no excuse for campaign, some aspects of MP, like custom games with bots, and portal to be online only.

Hopefully they plan on adding that later on, and again....it should be a standard, either for launch, or post launch, for ALMOST all games.

PS. I'm talking for games where offline/local play make sense. I understand there are games where it makes sense for it to be online only.

PSS. On that BF6 post I wrote, someone said ""everyone should have internet in 2025"", and while I disagree with that idea, I do feel allowing for offline/local play can even benefit those with internet, since....no one should lag, have to wait in a queue, etc. for a campaign.

1o89ur5,Playing fewer games made me appreciate them more,gaming,1760629923.0,71,0,False,"**TLDR**. By playing fewer games, I actually enjoy them more and find it easier to pick something I genuinely want to play instead of feeling bored by abundance.

Has anyone had a similar experience and how did you approach it? I hope these kind of posts are allowed here.

So, full story: I tend to wait at least 1 year before picking up newer titles (for the benefit of fixed bugs, lower prices, and stabler impressions). Still, **choosing what to play became increasingly hard for me lately, and when I started a game, I’d lose interest quickly**. What bothered me most: 1) Everything felt derivative. I felt I've played similar things before. The market felt increasingly oversaturated (here I don't just mean new titles). 2) I felt too many games don’t respect the player’s time. You wouldn’t design software with 80s usability. So no need for games to lack basic QoL or put up pointless restrictions.

What I did: I first stopped playing for a week or two to reset. Then I decided to cut my playtime roughly in half, from 12-16 hours/week to 4-8 hours/week. Over a few weeks, I settled into a new routine:

* Deleted my backlog (and won’t make a new one). I just play something if I really feel like it. No FOMO.
* Play only top rated games in genres I enjoy (both indie and AAA). I've limited my time, so I can't afford FOMO about mediocre titles (which still shine in their moments, of course).
* Skip any game that wastes time, for example with poor QoL or filler content.
* Give new games a fair chance, but if I’m not having real fun after an hour or two, I drop them.

During this I found that I was actually excited to play games again. So my time feels better spent overall. What I do with the extra time: go to the gym more & do more cardio, read more books, and watch more shows and movies.

Now that I’ve written it out, it seems painfully obvious. My main mistake was probably thinking that boredom with one game meant I needed to find another. Usually, I just needed a short break. Unless you’re deep into competitive gaming, it makes sense that playing constantly makes even good games feel repetitive. 

I guess pacing myself or taking breaks keeps a hobby fun. Unfortunately, that ""filthy casual / skill issue"" mindset makes it hard or impossible to get into certain genres (for example, I finished BB and DS3 for the first time during Covid when I had much more time, I guess I couldn't get into them today). But the alternative is losing motivation due to burnout, which is worse.",True

I don't want promotion or need upvotes or anything, I just love sharing my love of video games)**

I wrote this (added/edit: as an opinion piece on a blog) in Dec 2023 when the game first came out, and I decided to just post the whole thing here directly as I don't wanna mess with getting in trouble with self-promotion or link sharing, and I wanna share it because I think the game just deserves to be played by more people, because it's great and it's now on a big sale on Xbox ($18) and also on PS Plus:

Alan Wake wasn’t just one of the best games to release on Xbox 360, it was one of the best games of the entire generation. 13 years later, I still can’t believe a sequel is here, and after completing the game, I’m asking myself if this will be thought of in the same way. I loved the first Alan Wake a lot. Like, a whole lot. In the middle of my Alan Wake 2 playthrough I jumped into the backwards compatible version on Xbox Series X and loaded into one of my old saves – and I’ll be damned if it doesn’t still look and feel great. I love that it has this great horror theme without strictly being a horror itself, and I love that the combat and gameplay keeps things super tense without being overly scary. I love horror, but I love that Alan Wake was a more accessible type of horror story, especially for those who usually keep away from the scary stuff. Alan Wake 2 is a very different game to Alan Wake. The sequel makes a full shift to survival horror, leaving behind many of the reasons I liked the first game so much, but I really love that Remedy was confident enough to not just update an old formula, but completely evolve everything about Alan Wake with the sequel.

There are a few things about the gameplay systems that I don’t love, but I’ll get back to that in a bit. Remedy games are anything but average, and Alan Wake 2’s story and setting is an ambitious continuation of the first game, with the time between the first and second game being the same real time that’s passed between the release of the first game and its sequel.

What really makes things exciting – and I’m not going to say much about this – is that since CONTROL, we now know that some Remedy games may share a connected universe, and the way they’re going about it feels very smart and restrained – unlike, you know, the way some other people handle this sort of thing. Alan Wake, the tortured writer who’s been trapped in the dark place for 13 years, now shares the limelight and torchlight with a second protagonist, Saga Anderson, an FBI agent who travels to Bright Falls with her partner that looks a whole lot like Max Payne – not that one, and for intellectual property reasons, not this one either – to investigate a series of murders. As you might expect, things start going a little “Stephen-King-y” pretty quick, with the bigger story then unfolding over the 20-30 hour campaign.

Something pretty neat is that in many of the Resident-Evil-esque saferooms, you can use a, well… bucket, to swap between Alan and Saga to progress their stories as they spiral towards the conclusion. With Saga in the forests and familiar surroundings of Bright Falls and Alan in the “dark place”, represented as a twisted version of Alan’s perception of New York, it’s a nice literal change of scenery when you swap between them. Saga is also leading in investigation which she manages in her “mind place”, and I loved the aspects of working through case files, linking evidence and discoveries or profiling characters – detective stuff is my jam. Alan, on the other hand, uses a really nifty mechanic where he changes the story of his book to alter his surroundings and open up new scenarios and paths. I really loved just how seamless and creative it all was. Interestingly enough, the game that kept coming to mind the most while playing Alan Wake 2 was actually The Evil Within 2, the survival horror from the same studio responsible for other horrific terrors such as, err… Hi-Fi Rush.

The move to survival horror means that Alan Wake 2 loses many of the elements that I really loved from the first game, like burning away words with your flashlight, a bigger focus on skedaddling from one light to the next and a focus on tension over scares, exchanging them for a more traditional horror game setup, including inventory management, save rooms and over-the-shoulder gun combat. Also, make no mistake, Alan Wake 2 can be scary as balls sometimes, and environments that look like they come out of Silent Hill don’t help either. That said, some of the jump scare tactics are a little cheap and overused. The combat itself is clunky and frustrating at times. I’d jumped back into the Resident Evil 7 Remake again just before playing Alan Wake 2 and also played the Dead Space Remake earlier in the year, and despite being such a similar combat system, Alan Wake 2 easily takes third place where combat is concerned. Since we’ve lost the slow-motion and tension aspects of Alan Wake 1, I often found it very tricky to keep track of enemies, but in a frustrating way, not a scary or challenging way. Inventory management could also be better and didn’t really feel like it added too much to the experience.

The world is filled with discoverable stashes or puzzles that range from looking around the environment to doing some pretty gnarly maths problems. What I really love is that you’re often just left to deal with it – no annoying hints being blurted out by your character. It sometimes left me frustrated that I couldn’t figure them out, and I even missed out on having some good gear for longer than necessary – but I liked that it respected me as a player, and let it be my problem. Google is just a few phone taps away anyways, right? On that note, pacing could be better too, as I often found myself sort of just wombling around for long periods of time – and even with the world being semi-open for you to explore, I was never quite sure if I should go exploring down a side path or if the area I see on the map is an area I might need to visit as a part of the main story later.

Alan Wake 2 is still a fun game to play, although it feels clear that the storytelling came first for Remedy, and while I think that means that Alan Wake 2’s core gameplay could have been even better, I can really respect the focus on what they felt was the most important aspects of the experience. What really helps to support the great story and discoveries, is that following on from the high standards set by CONTROL, Alan Wake 2 has some of the best graphics I’ve ever seen running on a console, while the music and soundtrack created for the game is top notch and a big part of the experience itself. I also wanted to note that I really loved that the characters would often make exclamations like that you’d expect from someone in the situation, often mirroring what I was saying and thinking as well. I had the option of a performance mode that targets 60fps or a quality mode that targets 30fps but considering the pace of the game and the importance of the audio/visual aspects, I very happily opted to stick to the quality mode and was happy I did. The image can get noisy at times, but the atmosphere provided by thick fog, dramatic lighting, beautiful reflections and incredibly detailed characters, environments and objects had me in a constant state of awe.

The game jumps between real video footage and video game graphics, and we’re getting so close to real looking visuals that these sorts of jumps are barely even jarring anymore. It was also pretty polished at launch, although I had a few issues with cut or delayed audio a few times.

So, does it deserve to be Game of the Year? The excellent details or little frustrations are almost irrelevant next to the real reason that Alan Wake 2 is so special and why it deserves to be considered as the best Game of the Year. 2023 may be filled with many great games, but how many of them truly delivered an experience that you haven’t already sort of seen or played in some form before. Sure, some gameplay elements may be a little familiar, but Alan Wake 2 is wildly experimental with its storytelling and presentation on top of still delivering a video game that’s wholly engrossing, fun to play and incredibly good to look at. As a sequel to Alan Wake, it’s a bold shift in genre and story that’s usually only seen in reboots. As a continuation of Remedy’s connected universe, it’s an exciting next step that opens up the door for even more mystery and discovery. The door has definitely been left wide open. Alan Wake 2 is what it looks like when a team that’s capable, confident and firing on all cylinders puts all their trust and energy into a focused vision by a creator that really seems to know what the hell they are doing. But hey, Alan Wake 2 is just a video game, but it’s also not just a video game at all. It’s the rare combination of technical mastery and artistic vision that furthers our understanding of what video game experiences can be. 

So, does Alan Wake 2 live up to the 13 years of expectations that I built up for myself? Well, no it doesn’t, because I expected to get more of the same, with a few twists and some better graphics. Instead, it was something very different and unexpected that pushed Remedy’s excellent approach to storytelling and immersive experiences to another level… and I can’t see how that isn’t a whole lot better.

1o7k2vr,Capcom had to be convinced to put the PS1 Resident Evils on GOG. Thought the Remakes provided the superior experience,gaming,1760555209.0,456,0,False,">""Capcom were like, 'we have all of those remakes. It's already the superior experience to those games.' They didn't really see the value in bringing back the vanilla versions. It took a lot of convincing that there is an audience that has a lot of memories about those games, and would love to experience exactly the same game again. Thankfully, we were able to convince them.

>""When we launched \[Resident Evil\] on GOG, the reception was absolutely phenomenal. We have 94% positive reviews on GOG for all of them. And that was also reflected in the sales. It proved that there is an audience for this. The classical versions, the versions we all remember from our childhood, they still hold a lot of value.""

I guess the bosses at Capcom never played the RE3 remake.

1o7dyyb,I'm Worried About Vampire The Masquerade Bloodlines 2,gaming,1760541702.0,0,0,False,"So I am concerned and have reservations about the game; I did the same thing with Veilguard, too.   From a mechanical standpoint point it resembles the Arcane games Dishonored, Prey, and so on.  I enjoy the gameplay of those immensely. Maybe it is just jitters or genuine nerves, I don't know. I heard about the 30 bucks for the other clans thing they tried to do.  On the same token, I heard they marched that back as soon as backlash emerged.  

I am hoping my anxiety over it is nothing, but its development cycle has been troubled, putting it mildly.  If you count how long it's been in the works, it damn near ties with Duke Nukem Forever.  Am I overthinking it? I just wanted to see what other people were feeling and get a broader perspective.   ",True
