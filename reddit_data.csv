Despite no resemblance, no singing ability, and just one week to prepare, he gives it everything he’s got.

FROM DAN: after a stand-up show, a woman approached me and said, “you must get this all the time - you look exactly like Michael Bublé.” (i do not.) she wanted to hire me as a Michael Buble impersonator for a real sum of money for a real fancy event. i had to sing ""Feelin' Good"" and hang out for 30 mins ""in-character"" as Bublé. it seemed insane—so i accepted. i filmed the whole journey for a doc short, Being Bublé, a true story that makes no sense... i researched Bublé, rented out a conference room to practice acting as him, hunted for the best suit, shot a Rocky training sequence, even met with a vocal coach who warned me NOT to sing. but i kept practicing that song. captured the whole lead-up, the gig, and the insane aftermath. you can see it here- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyXoJhBtntQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyXoJhBtntQ)

Being Buble is my favorite thing i've done. we made something that i hope is funny, strange, and ultimately heartfelt -- since that's how i found the whole process. the experience was pure joy. really proud of it.",False,912,0.92,61,1368,False

I grabbed what I thought was a regular ride.. this tuk tuk motorcycle that looked like it had seen several lifetimes and possibly a small war. Five minutes in, I realize something’s off. We’re not heading toward the bus terminal. We’re in the middle of this traffic jam, but everyone’s dancing. There’s music, flowers.. and people waving from cars dressed like they’re going to the Met Gala 👀 I’m sitting there holding my Alibaba backpack and a half-eaten mango, wondering if I’m in someone’s TikTok lol. Turns out the driver had mistaken me for part of a wedding procession! No joke. He’s laughing, people are cheering and suddenly someone hands me a small bouquet and says, “Welcome!” So I did what any confused foreigner would do, I smiled, waved, and committed fully to the bit 😅

We ended up parading through half the city like that. Strangers took selfies with me. Someone shoved a tiny cup of rice wine in my hand. When we finally stopped, the groom’s uncle thanked me for coming all the way for the ceremony and I just nodded and said, “Of course, wouldn’t miss it.” Eventually my actual driver found me (after I texted him a photo of my new family) and we both couldn’t stop laughing the whole way to the station.

I was feelin’ kinda weary,
Quoth the mirror, “Boy, you scary—
But damn, you could be fine.”
I’ve written odes to death and sorrow,
Dreamt no joy for each tomorrow,
Then I thought, “Why beg or borrow,
When I could sip this wine?”

Nevermore, I’ll cry in vain,
Nevermore, I’ll wear my pain—
Got lace and lust, not guilt or shame,
Call me Edgar Allan Hoe.
From crypt to club, I make it known,
My heart’s as black as onyx stone,
But tonight, I sin alone—
Yeah, I’m Edgar Allan Hoe.


Lenore said love was fleeting,
But my thirst needs constant feeding,
Now I’m ghostin’, never pleading,
Just vibin’ with the moon.
My quill drips ink and temptation,
Dark rhymes, divine flirtation,
A freak in poetic formation

Desire is my doom.


Hear the ravens on the wire,
Whisper tales of want and fire,
“Poe,” they croak, “you’ve gone entire—
From goth to gigolo.”
I just smirk beneath my cloak,
Light my candle, let it smoke,
In decadence I’m newly woke—
A cursed romantic pro.


Nevermore, I’ll grieve the dead,
I’ll kiss the living lips instead,
My soul’s still dark, but my bed’s well-fed,
Call me Edgar Allan Hoe.
Roses wilt and hearts decay,
But I’m still serving night and day,
In lace and sin, I’ll fade away—
Forever Edgar Allan Hoe.

A Pathologist examined the remains of all the crows, and, to everyone's relief, confirmed the problem was NOT Avian Flu. The cause of death appeared to be from vehicular impacts. However, during analysis it was noted there was a lack of paint on the bird's beaks and claws suggesting that 98% of the crows had been killed by impact with motorbikes, while only 2% were killed by cars.

The RCMP then hired an Ornithological Behaviourist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of motorbike kills versus car kills. The Ornithological Behaviourist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger.

They discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""Cah"", not a single one could shout ""bike""",True,0,0.19,27,913,False

Fenugreek supports digestion, controls blood sugar, reduces joint pain, and boosts strength, while gond and ghee help improve bone health, energy levels, and postpartum recovery. Jaggery adds iron and aids digestion, and the dry fruits and coconut provide healthy fats and overall immunity support. These laddoos are especially beneficial for new mothers, people with joint pain, those who feel weakness, and anyone needing long-lasting energy. However, they should be eaten in moderation by diabetics because of jaggery, and avoided by people with diarrhea, excess body heat, severe acidity, or PCOS (unless taken very occasionally).

Roll some prosciutto and cut into chunks, dice some chicken, mince some garlic and shallot, sllice some garlic, and mince up some sage and rosemary.

Start with browning the prosciutto to get some fat in the pan, crisp up the sliced garlic in said fat, then brown the chicken, and set everything aside.

In the same pan melt butter then add the minced garlic and shallot. Cook until fragrant, deglaze with white wine, and scrape up any bits stuck to the bottom.

Add the herbs, chicken stock, and bring to a simmer, then whisk in some cream. Let it simmer with a lemon until the lemon gets soft in the middle, remove it, thicken with flour, salt & pepper to taste, this will be the pizza sauce 😆

Get the dough ready by rolling some chicken into the crust, cover the middle with sauce, toss on the rest of the chicken, the prosciutto, then cover w/ mozzarella, bake @ 550° until the crust is browned.

Ingredients for 1 serving =

For the dough:

•370 g flour

•250 ml lukewarm water

•2 tbsp sugar ( white or brown )

•1 tsp dry yeast ( normal yeast works too )

•2 tsp salt

•1 tbsp olive oil

•Fat for greasing the pan ( I used butter )
____________________________________________________
For the garlic coating =

•4 garlic cloves

•5 parsley stems

•4 thyme sprigs ( dried, if you only have fresh ones, you can dry them on low heat in a pan ! )

•90 g cheese (strong-flavoured, e.g., mountain cheese) => I used parmesan cheese

•50 ml olive oil

•Salt


step by step =

1.- In a bowl mix the lukewarm water ( 250 ml ) with sugar, dry yeast and two tablespoons of flour and let it sit for 15 minutes.

2.- In a seperate bowl mix flour and salt, add the yeast mixture ( after letting it sit for 15 minutes ) and add one tablespoon of olive oil.

3.- knead the dough for 5-10 minutes.

4.- clean one of the bowls and put oil on the inside walls so the dough won't stick then put the doigh inside, cover with cling film and let it rest for 1 hour.

5.- Preheat your oven ( 200°C or 392°F  top/bottom heat ).

6.- In the meantime peel the garlic and chop it up ( or use a garlic press ) ,
remove the stems from the parsley and chop it up
remove the thyme leaves from the stem and dry the thyme in a pan on low heat ( or use dried thyme from the store ). cut the parmesan cheese into small pieces. mix everything with 50 ml olive oil and add a sprinkle of salt.

7.- grease a springform pan with butter or just put baking paper inside the pan.

8.- knead the dough and shape it into a roll.

9.- cut the dough into equal size pieces ( should be about 7 ) and shape them into little balls.
! I advise putting a tiny bit of olive oil onto your hands before shaping so the dough wont stick to them !

10.- roll your dough balls in the garlic cheese mixture.
Don't be stingy, make a thick coating!

11.- put the dough balls into the springpan ( mine has a diameter of 20.5 cm / 8.07 inches ) .

12.- bake on middle baking rack for 35 minutes ( 200°C top / bottom heat ) or [ 392°F ].

Enjoy!

I've had it in many restaurants and they give us the following on the side, how do we eat it? Usually my family eats just the chicken and saffron rice, but it feels wasteful not to eat it with the condiments provided and I want to enjoy it as intended.

Sides that we have received are:

* flatbread
* white onion (raw)
* butter (or some kind of sauce)
* limes
* roasted tomato (we eat it with the chicken and its delicious)

When we were at the restaurant picking up our to-go we saw someone taking bite between the onion and the kebab, is that how you're supposed to eat it? Just wondering how its typically enjoyed so I can learn, I love trying food from different cultures as it's one of the great things about the world--thanks for taking the time to read and help!

It all started with 2 people and has expanded to 8 with the occasional plus or minus. I usually set the menu but will take requests and once a month I reserve the right to pull a pizza card if I am too busy to cook or if I want to relax. Except for some crowd pleasers like smash burgers, wings, or hibachi fried rice I try not to repeat dishes, this is becoming more challenging. I usually try to keep cost at $10-$15 per person. I am an above average cook, but not as good as people make me out to be. 

The past 2 years we have done “Friendsmas”, sometime around the holiday we have a gathering usually on a Saturday so I have more time to cook. We have a fancier meal, and a gift exchange. Year one I made prime rib, roasted rainbow carrots, Brussels sprout salad , and Yorkshire puddings. Year 2 was beef Wellington, butternut squash risotto, potato’s pave, and some crusty bread. I’m looking for some ideas to knock their socks off this year. I’m budgeting $40-$60 per person. 

Info about the eaters:
One shellfish allergy, I would still
Consider a side with shellfish but not a main. He enjoys it/eats it just gets sweaty/itchy. 
One doesn’t like raw cilantro, but if it’s cooked in the dish doesn’t care. 
All are meat eaters, organ meat is only appreciated by half the group. 
Half are heavy eaters, think double a normal serving size. 
Ok with spice, most really like some heat. One tolerates it.
Any country of origin is accepted, I cook a lot of Asian fusion dishes. 

I have all standard cooking/serving items. 
Also have:
Grill
Smoker
Flattop grill 
Sous vide
KitchenAid
Meat grinder
Deep fryer
Wood-fire pizza oven. 

Any suggestions of what you would consider a fancy holiday meal with friends would be greatly appreciated. ",True,0,0.33,44,1947,True

1oxa2fi,r/Food Rules Update: 2025,food,1763157952.0,33,0,32,False,"**Hi**!

As 2025 is quickly nearing to a close, and so that people can make the most of these changes over the December Holidays, we have revised our sub rules. These went live 2 weeks ago and the final touches to automod went live early this week.

Below is an in-depth explanation on the changes, if you still have questions after, please feel free to ask in the comments and I'll do my best to answer. 

**Original images / videos only**

* **Current (now)**: If you didn’t take the photo or video, don’t post it. No stock, AI, stolen, or screenshots.
* **Old (before)**: Original Images only (OC Only). - If you didn’t take the photo, don’t post it.
* **Explanation**: Dropped the ""OC"" term as I feel like it's less relevant in current Reddit culture terminology. Added some specific examples in to make things clearer. Oh and we now allow videos of your own food uploaded to Reddit's own native hosting 🎉

**Title format**

* **Current (now):** For Images and video, the majority of your title must specifically describe what the food is. We also allow locations, who made it and noting attempts. Any other post, keep it descriptive. A \[TAG\] is always needed.
* **Old (before):** “The majority of your title (over 50%) must specifically describe the food. Avoid vague descriptions, excessive use of emojis, and include one \[square-bracketed\] tag. Do not use personal appeals or emotionally compelling details, like hardships, to influence votes. Posts are removed at moderators' discretion.”
* **Explanation**: We've still kept the 50% specific description of what the food is, this keeps Google happy as your posts will end up in Google searches about your foods (keeps your posts popular for the long run). I think we'll keep it at this level for the foreseeable. Slimmed the rest of the rule right down and flipped it more to mention what we do allow. Also we don't really have to care as much about Emoji's, All Caps and where our \[Tags\] are. We hadn't updated the rule regarding other types of posts now available here, but we're going to keep them pretty loosely moderated.

**Title Tags**

* **Current (now):**  **\[I ate\]** \- Food you purchased and ate with no preparation of your own. (Restaurant / Food truck / Food Vendor).  -  **\[Homemade\]** \- Food made at home by you or someone you know.  -  **\[Pro/Chef\]** \- Made as part of your work in food.   -  **\[Text\]** \- Text posts for help, feedback, long recipes.  -  **\[Produce\]** \- Raw ingredients grown, foraged, butchered, or purchased, shown as ingredients.  -  **\[Podcast\]** \- Food podcasts.  -  **\[AMA\]** \- Food AMAs with special guests.
* **Old (before):** Pretty much the same list.
* **Explanation**: Food Podcasts can now be posted by anyone (not just approved users) but our self promotion rules still apply. If the domain gets blocked, modmail us about it (because podcast domains are kind of odd to track down). We've also changed the AMA wording to special guests instead of just arranged via the mod team.

**Be nice**

* **Current (now):** Respect others. Do not belittle or devalue users or their food.
* **Old (before):** Please be respectful and do not belittle users or their food.
* **Explanation**: Just a slight wording change, still pretty much the same meaning. 

**Blog and website links**

* **Current (now):** All website links are filtered, except those listed on our domain Whitelist. Changes to the list is at moderator discretion via modmail. To have your own domain approved you need to meet the below: **\[Same 3 points in old and new version\]**
* **Old (before):** All domains linked in posts and comments are filtered, except those listed on our domain Whitelist. Addition or Removal to the list is at moderator discretion.
* **Explanation**: Dropped ""domains"" for ""website links"" as it's easier to understand (but obviously didn't change the second mention of it ""nice, well done😅"", well it's 50% better at least). Stated that changes are made via modmail and details making it clearer that the three points where for your own websites (self promotion). 

**No excessively low quality media**

* **Current (now)**: No excessively blurred, small, dark, or cropped media where the food is not visible.
* **Old (before)**: No Low-Quality Posts or Comments.
* **Explanation**: This is where the big changes start, this rule title we enforced for the quality of some really bad images. But, over **YEARS** we had slowly slapped other random rules under this title and the rule lost all meaning and was confusing. Most of these are now their own rules with descriptions. This rule now properly states that if we can't see the food because the images is too bad, we'll remove it.  

**No unauthorised self‑promotion**

* **Current (now):** No unauthorised self-promotion, off site social links/watermarks.
* **Old (before):** Self‑promotion and off‑site social links lived inside the broad ‘No Low‑Quality Posts or Comments’ bucket with many other items.
* **Explanation**: Simple small rule that still gives a nod towards the website/blog rule with ""unauthorised"", as we clearly do authorise some self promotion when it's been agreed with us. It's a bit more of a description than before, better than none at all and doesn't really need more than that. 

**No fast food chains or minimal‑effort pre‑packaged foods/snacks**

* **Current (now):** No media from large fast food chains or minimal effort pre-packaged foods/snacks (sweets/frozen meals etc).
* **Old (before):** Lived as a line item (“Chain/Pre‑Packaged Food”) inside the big low‑quality list.
* **Explanation**: Again, cleaned up the single line rule to have it's own description and also worded it to be more in-line with what we removed and actioned. Places like McDonalds have spent Millions (probably closer to billions) over generations making sure EVERYONE knows who they are, even using things like kids play areas to make sure kids grew up with the brand. We want zero part in adding to their advertising portfolio. As for packaged stuff, it's very very low effort and we only really ever see posts about special chips (crisps) or chocolate, which are mostly a marketing gimmick.

  
**No political comments or titles**

* **Current (now):** Do not bring politics into comments or titles.
* **Old (before):** “Politics” appeared in the long low‑quality list and as part of general guidance.
* **Explanation**: Pretty simple, doesn't need much description, but it did need one. No ""Vote"" pies are not politics, stop asking us to remove them, also go vote.

**Video posts must use Reddit’s own hosting**

* **Current (now):** Links to YouTube, TicTok, Insta etc are automatically blocked.
* **Old (before):** Lived inside the broad ‘No Low‑Quality Posts or Comments’ bucket with many other items as ""No Videos"". 
* **Explanation**: We now allow Reddit hosted videos, so this needed expanding. Posts that are just YouTube videos, TicTok's, Insta/Reels have a financial incentive and also have VERY strong shortform video traps in them. If you click out to one of those sites, you're most likely not going to click back into Reddit any time soon. YouTube comments are also filtered and checked by us as to their suitability, we didn't really need a rule about it, as it'll fall under a generic removal rule later on here. 

**No culture‑war comments**

* **Current (now):** Reddit-born meme replies and culture war comments that target posters will be removed. They are off topic, unhelpful, and drive away real contributors. Examples include “Melt” on grilled cheese, “Not a burger” on chicken burgers, degrading TV show quotes or fights over international food differences.
* **Old (before):** As an extension of the ""Be Nice"" rule, abusive circlejerks will be subject to removal and/or a ban. This can result in an immediate permanent ban depending on the severity: \[Same kind of examples list\].
* **Explanation**: Big rework of this rule to use less Reddit ""in"" words and to use more plain English. Expanded on the ""why"" in the rule itself. Internally we're also looking to revise our ban procedure for this rule to be less instant perma bans and use removals first. Leave bans for those being especially mean or for users that do it a lot (trolls). 

**Moderator discretion**

* **Current (now):** Mods may remove any post, comment, or user if deemed detrimental to the community.
* **Old (before):** Mods may remove any post, comment or user, if the post, comment or user is deemed detrimental to the community.
* **Explanation**: It's always been an end note under our old rules, this didn't fit Reddit's new rule structure, so it's now a full rule. Pretty simple but it'll be the catch all for edge cases and something to shut down users that like to ""Rule Lawyer"". 

**Additional mentions**: 

* You won't see the old ""Dietary activism"" rule anywhere in the list now. We didn't need to really expressly mention it, it all falls under ""Be Nice"" very easily, or being a user ""detrimental"" to the community. At the end of the day, we're a general food sub, not your soap box to virtue signal from the top of.
* We're always looking at the long-game and the wider picture with our rules. ""What keeps users feeling ""safe"" to post here and enjoy the sub?"" is a question we will always look to answer over and over again. We also balance all changes to make sure post types, user skill, and levels of profession are balanced and work together.
* We do value and protect posters above users that comment. Reddit can be VERY harsh and the vast majority of that negativity is from comments. We're first and foremost a food sub and those creating, making, purchasing or working with food and posting it here add huge value to the sub. A 10 year old, kinda' not ""okay"" in this day and age, Tv quote as a ""joke"" on a post ... not so much.



Any other questions, again, let me know in the comments and I'll try to answer them.

1ottbiy,About future Bon Appétit/Condé Nast AMAs on r/Food,food,1762816533.0,0,0,5,False,"Recently, r/Food hosted two AMAs with guests from Bon Appétit. Engagement on the second AMA was very low. In looking at this, we also have to acknowledge prior and ongoing issues at Condé Nast/Bon Appétit, including the recent firing of a trans staff member and union organiser. If we continued to run BA AMAs, it’s clear that these concerns would understandably become a major focus for questions.

Our AMA policy has a core value of “Championing Diversity, Inclusion, and Uplifting/Amplifying Voices,” with a specific focus on women, BIPOC, LGBT, and other marginalised people whose voices aren’t always heard in food spaces. Who we choose to feature as guests needs to reflect this policy.

At this time, Bon Appétit/Condé Nast have confirmed to us that they are not in a position to address these new concerns directly in an AMA format. Continuing to run BA AMAs under those conditions would feel inconsistent with our stated values and with what we expect from guests we host here.

For that reason, we will not be scheduling further Bon Appétit AMAs on r/Food for the foreseeable future. We appreciate the guests who have already joined us, and we also stand in solidarity with marginalised staff and creators in food media who are affected by these decisions.

Going forward, we’ll continue to use our AMA slots for guests who are ready to engage openly with your questions and who clearly align with our AMA core values around diversity, inclusion, and uplifting underrepresented voices.

The too lazy didn't read of it is that I had broken a tooth when I was a kid, and the replacement had lasted me a good 30+ years, but finally broke, too, so as I was getting it replaced, I was on a soft foods diet.  Now, I have nothing against tofu, per se.  I used to moonlight at an Asian restaurant where I was paid crap, but at least was fed dinner five nights a week.  I never did like it when one Thai guy, a chubby little ball of laughter and happiness who chose the Americanized name of Ninja would make my food because it was always mung bean noodles, peas, mushrooms, some sauces, and tofu.  He would hook me up with extra tofu, which ...I really did appreciate him for it, but I mean, I could feel my soul leaving my body when I would eat it.  And it's not his fault that Buddhists don't believe in souls, but he made mine sad.  Grateful, but sad.

So, when tofu came up as literally the top protein of choice for my current predicament, the answer was an absolute, no possible way, not in a million years, no.  Except when I had forgotten about all that and I got tofu.

Anyhoo, I wasn't able to have like ...steak, or chicken, but I could have the ground versions of it all.  Ground beef was a little too rich for my blood, and ground chicken is absolute garbage except in Dino Nugget form, so, as God works in mysterious ways, my sausage guy at work started offering me free or discounted packs he had made that were too small for retail, so the natural step was to add something cheap and filling: biscuits and gravy.

It started off as the traditional, then I got my hands on chorizo, bangers, ancho...  Tonight's was a hot Italian blend.  My wife said it smelled like pizza.

Just wanted to share a little experiment I did with my peppers I grew this year. It's something I've never tried before and I really had no clue if it was going to work, but I'm happy (and surprised) to say it worked out fantastic. I'm sure this has been done before but I've never heard of it myself and couldn't really find anything online about combining fermentation and salt-curing for peppers.

I put a bunch of fresh peppers in a glass jar (I used Chilhuacle Negro but I'm sure most types work), filled it with salt and let it ferment + dry at the same time for a few weeks, emptying out the accumulated water every few days. When they were about 70% dry and had a clear fermented smell I poured them out, rinsed them lightly in water to get off the salt covering them and then let them air dry. With this method you get both the benefits from dry peppers and fermented peppers. They are salty like an olive is and have a deep umami, smoky, almost tobacco like smell. I was honestly blown away how much they tasted compared to a fresh pepper.

1osbq2v,[Homemade] I decided to make Japanese Curry!,food,1762668130.0,222,0,17,False,"As per the post, I made a Japanese curry; I'll freely admit that the base is S&B Golden Curry, but I added to the product and I'm very happy with the result! The recipe is somewhat loose regarding vegetable/protein portions; adjust it to fit your own tastes!
Also, the chicken katsu was an afterthought, but ended up being the best version I've ever made!

Recipe:
3 lb chicken breast (or just 3 chicken breasts) divided (Cube 2/3 to go into the curry, the other 1/3 will be for the katsu)
3 medium white onions, coarsely chopped
1 lb baby carrots (or just a mid-sized bag)
2 cans bamboo shoots 
1 lb mushrooms, coarsely chopped
Golden potatoes (I didn't measure this, but I'd say I used about 2 lbs)
2 packs S&B Golden Curry Medium Hot mix
MSG to taste (be VERY sparing with this)
Ponzu Sauce to taste
Black pepper to taste
White pepper to taste
Red Pepper to taste
Salt to taste
Dried turneric to taste
Grated Ginger root to taste
Grated Turmeric to taste
All the garlic

Cube 2/3 of the chicken breast; with the other 1/3, cut the breast in half horizontally and then fillet.
Coat both cubed chicken and filleted chicken with salt, turmeric, black pepper, red pepper, and white pepper and a tiny sprinkle of ms.  Pan sear the cubed chicken with a bit of veg oi and sesame oil; the filleted chicken will go through an egg wash and then dredged in breadcrumbs mixed with the same blend used on the chicken. (in a perfect world I'd have used panko, but I only had generic store bought breadcrumbs since it was an afterthought)  then pan fried.

Meanwhile!
 Chop potatoes and onions and toss into a large pot with the carrots; add water to cover and start to boil; keep the boil going for about 5 minutes then reduce heat to simmer. 
 Next we add the S&B Curry; it's similar to a boullion cube in that it comes in large blocks that are meant to dissolve in water. I grated the blocks from both packages with the fine side of a cheese grater; then I submerged a large fine-mesh strainer into the pot with the vegetables (the goal is to create a space of just water within the pot but which still lets the water flow freely) and whisked the grated curry block into the simmering vegetable pot. During this whole process, I simply seasoned as I went using the spices and herbs listed.

After the curry is incorporated into the veg, I added the bamboo shoots, few splashes of Ponzu (I wanted the salt from the soy but thought the acid from the citrus would help balance the dish...it did!), grated ginger, grated turmeric, and minced garlic. 20 minutes later I added the chicken and mushrooms while the katsu fried.

Finally, I first plated it like the stereotypical Japanese curry we all see in anime etc; then I added the katsu, some coursely chopped cilantro, green onions, and a few lime wedges for more acid. I used jasmine rice because I love its fragrance.

I know what indie traditionally means but let's be real, indie culture in general represents the games made with little to no budget (sometimes just funded by fans) by a small or 1 man dev teams. I don't think anyone would call a game made by Elon Musk ""indie"" just because he did not worked with any big publisher. 

I don't know what everyone expects from an indie game but when I play an indie game I expect good-innovative gameplay before everything else and even like it when I see devs trying to keep the budget low in some smart ways like really basic but catchy music, animation that only consists of 1-2 pixels moving etc. I think ""indie"" as a whole should be preserved like a different culture, and an indie game should be something that is made with limited budget so as a result of that some aspects of the game should be cheaped out on in creative ways for game to be good. Expedition 33 for example, while not having a big publisher behind it still had enough money to deliver an overall solid game on all sides without any need for thinking about how to save money while making major elements of the game. I think even just putting a budget or team size limit for games would make a lot more games have a chance in events like game awards.

Imagine a game like Arc Raiders. But add the synergistic team element of a marvel rivals. You load into the map with 2-3 other teams, center (or better yet, dynamic) high priority objective, secondary objectives all around, and one life per person. Goal is to grab the highest value stuff you can, and then hit one of the extracts. And kill everything in between. You could all run towards the high priority area And try and team wipe, you can have one or two people go over there and just distract the other team while the rest of your team clears the map of everything valuable... You can start losing the battle at the high priority location, pull back and send one of the people looting on the sides just to get some guaranteed stuff back over to their extract to stop that guy....

The biggest issue would be the match end and reward component. It definitely wouldn't work to have people stuck in until round completion, no one's going to want to die and then sit there and spectate the last guy on their team sneaking around for 20 plus minutes. I think if you had individual rewards, based off combat, which you individually extracted with, as well as a team-based win / lose reward.... It could work well. It would have to be different than anything we have now, but it could absolutely work.

1ozq1u4,Unpopular Opinion: Expedition 33 Is Good But Not the Masterpiece People Call It,gaming,1763408397.0,0,0,217,False,"Expedition 33 is, honestly, one of the most overrated games I’ve seen in a long time. It’s definitely not a masterpiece, and it only ended up being this overhyped because several factors aligned at just the right time. Then the snowball effect kicked in, people jumped on the train way too fast, and suddenly it was being sold as if it were the most groundbreaking game of the last decade.

I’m not saying it’s a bad game. “Overrated” does not mean “bad.” But let’s be a bit serious here.

First of all, 33 has an extremely slow start, and its supposedly “punchy” opening scenes don’t actually hit emotionally at all. The game begins with a few random characters being wiped out, people we don’t know, don’t care about, and have no emotional connection to, and then the rest of Expedition 33 gets erased as well. We haven't even bonded with the main cast yet, and we’re already watching half the people on screen die without feeling anything. Act 1 goes by without much emotional impact; you spend the whole time trying to figure out the world and the combat system.

Speaking of combat: the blend of turn-based mechanics and quick-time elements is something I did enjoy. It’s not revolutionary, but in practice it’s one of the better executions I’ve seen, and honestly one of the main reasons the game works as well as it does. But even that becomes repetitive very fast. Battles start turning into dull sequences where you’re doing the same things every 10 minutes. Before long, I found myself avoiding fights just to keep things moving.

The UI/menu design is also one of the game’s weaker points. It takes way too long to get used to, and constantly navigating dozens of options across 3–4 characters becomes confusing and tedious.

As time goes on, the world and characters do start landing better. The story eventually gets interesting, the music and voice acting are genuinely great, and the game delivers some strong moments. But Act 3 is, in my opinion, the weakest part of the whole experience. It’s basically doing the same things we’ve been doing for hours just faster, more chaotically, and with less fun. Easily my least enjoyable section.

Returning to Lumiere and then chasing Renoir again just felt like dragging things out. And I’m genuinely shocked that the ending impacted people as much as it did. It’s almost “Lost finale” level in the sense of: “Yep, it was all a dream.” Except here it’s: “It was all just a painting.” After spending hours forming emotional bonds with characters, the game suddenly cuts us off from all of that and throws us into a family drama I couldn’t care less about. Choosing between the two endings didn’t affect me at all at that point. Why would I feel anything about one family’s personal tragedy when the supposedly “real” world and dozens of characters I interacted with turn out to be nothing?

I think the game’s storytelling style and narrative setup are genuinely strong, but the ending and its emotional payoff are nowhere near as powerful as people claim.

And here’s the bigger issue: for a game being hyped up as “Game of the Year,” I find it bizarre that the main selling point is its story and characters. We’re talking about GOTY awards, not Oscar nominations. Since when did GOTY stop being about gameplay, level design, mechanics, QoL, innovation, accessibility, and overall fun and become all about story, music, and character arcs? Best music, best narrative, best performance… are we watching the Emmys?

Look, I completely understand the admiration. Creating a game this polished with a relatively small budget and a small independent studio is impressive. The fact that the team left Ubisoft a studio known for some of the most formulaic games ever and built something like this on their own is admirable. They totally deserve the praise they got.

But someone needs to say it: Expedition 33 is easily one of the most overrated games of recent years.

1ozk4bj,Where Winds Meet feels like a full priced game,gaming,1763395369.0,0,0,72,False,"[It's currently sitting at 81% on Steam.](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3564740/Where_Winds_Meet/)

I was skeptical but after playing it all weekend, I can safely say it's the first F2P open world RPG I've played that has ever hooked me.

Tried Genshin, Conan, LotR Online, and other F2P open world games but dropped them all within 2-3 hrs. 

But in WWM, the combat reminds me of Dark Souls, the 10,000 NPCs in Kaifeng with their own schedules is kinda mind blowing, the graphics are great (but need work to stabilize quality) & the photo mode is as robust as any full priced game out there. The world is dense with stuff to do, too.

Dont get me wrong, its not a perfect game by any means but the devs have already stated they're working on improving it.

A 150 hr solo campaign for $0 (and optional $$$ cosmetics/battlepass) with the quality of a full priced game is a pretty good deal to me.

If your currency is worth more than the US Dollar you will pay 80 in your currency (with some exceptions like the UK) however if your currency is more inflated you will pay 80 USD just converted to your currency, that’s why Australians are asked to pay more than 110 Aussie dollars for a game

80€ which is the current AAA rate translates to 93$

Microsoft seems more interested in turning everything into a Game Pass subscription ecosystem. At this point I half expect them to release a “console” that’s just a green Roku stick.

So today we're having breakfast and we were talking about her day at the gym this week... and then, out of the blue, she goes:

""Oh you remember those two friends of mine (two women) you met when you came to watch my CrossFit event this summer? ... Well I saw them this week, I invited them over next Sunday, and we decided that we're going to have a Hot Chocolate/Xbox night""

The high cost has also led to a rise in more and more micro-transaction systems (skin packs, micro-DLCs, battlepasses, subscriptions, etc.) to guarantee a return on the initial investment.   
  
The allure of generative AI is that is can decrease the largest expenditure in game development and decrease the number of employees and the time needed to output a product. The downside is that there are several ethical concerns over gen-AI usage and a concern over the homogenization of artstyle and gameplay due to how gen-AI models are trained using existing materials.

My argument is that if the cost is going down for game publishers/investors and the products will suffer some samey-ness in design, then buyers should be re-considering the payment structures of these products in regards to the contents. I do not believe that the excuse of ""they have to raise prices and sell more items in the in-game store because of inflating game development costs"" will hold as well when costs are being sharply decreased due to gen-AI. 

We are already seeing it in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, but there were no reciprocal cost decreases or increase in content for the buyer. All game publishers and developers are discussing how to include gen-AI in their processes to decrease costs, I would advise buyers to look for those that are using it to the betterment of product valuation to the consumer over the revenue increase to the investor.",True,0,0.4,190,1575,True

I'm also not a fan of a potential all-digital future. I don't like the idea at all.

However, I would not give up on gaming if all consoles removed their disc drives / cartridge slots and there were no more complete physical editions, and when I see people say they would, I can't help but think they obviously couldn't have really liked games that much in the first place. The number one point of games is and always will be to play them. If it's not, I don't know what you are, but you're not really a gamer, that's for sure.

Don't get me wrong, all the other stuff can be cool too, and I throw no shade at those who want to own stuff related to a game they love, but if owning a disc has become MORE important to you than the experience of playing the game itself, I'm sorry, but you're completely detatched from what makes gaming gaming. If you'd forgo the experience of playing all the incredible new games we get every year, if you'd deliberately miss out on new entries in what you say are your favourite series purely because you can't own the data on a physical item, those games and series couldn't have been very important to you in the first place.

1oyc3cz,Shuntaro Furukawa is the reason Nintendo has become so anti-consumer.,gaming,1763266358.0,0,0,55,False,"Shuntaro Furukawa is the current President of Nintendo of Japan. He succeeded Tatsumi Kimishima in June 18, 2018. I'll get straight to the point, everything that Nintendo has been doing recently that's anti-consumer as hell, has all been from the decisions of one person, and that's Furukawa. 

We rarely got discounts on the switch, and it was always just some niche Nintendo games, never the best selling ones. Even if we got discounts, the lowest they would go to is like $45. You have other games, huge open-world games being discounted at like $20, I'm talking about games like Witcher 3, Skyrim, and RDR2, but Nintendo can't discount their games to even $30, even long after it's launch date. Nintendo would have still had discounts, even if Iwata was still alive, because back then  Nintendo beleived in everyone being able to play their games at an affordable price. However the discounts all stopped the minute Furukawa became the new president.

Now we have Switch 2, a 450 dollar console that comes with 70-80 dollar games whose level of quality and content don't even come close to the level of other AAA games from other game companies. Even in Japan it's only $330, and no, it ain't no damn inflation (if it was, why does other countries have it more, depspite inflation being everywhere). It's because Japanese people more than any other country are more responsible their money, and Nintendo knows that. Furukawa was the first one to even have nerve to dare price their games at $80, when other publishers are far more humble with gamesl prices, that are made bigger and more fun for a much longer time. Furukawa never even shows his face at Nintendo Directs when even Iwata did, heck even Doug Bowser showed up once.

Consoles can be bricked now, left completely unplayable, which has never happened before, that is until Furukawa came in. Still no discounts on switch games, worse yet, we get old games sold to us for even higher prices, not even Sony and Xbox are that shameless. Switch 2 cartridges with high storage are probably made expensive by Nintendo, so third-party publishers won't want to buy it, why else would most of them buy game-key cards? Except for the ones that made special deals with Nintendo. 

Furukawa is bringing this company down, all he cares about is pleasing investors, that guy is absolutely not a gamer. He's making very incompetent decisions right now, it's working for now because people love Nintendo and Pokémon, but sooner or later, even Nintendo fans will get tired of getting hoodwinked. It all starts with the Nintendo vs. Pocketpair lawsuit, which I'm positive that Nintendo is going to lose.

>In early 2017, they left Telltale to take jobs at the San Francisco office of the French video-game giant Ubisoft, where they were tapped to work on a new project that until now has remained a secret.

>Herman and his team were developing a new entry in the beloved stealth-action *Splinter Cell* franchise, he told me. “I was so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it’s been dormant for a while,” Herman said. “And we thought we could tell a great story and do something the fans would love.”

>They worked on the project for a few months before they got disrupted by executive whims. Ubisoft was at the time growing obsessed with games as a service (GAAS), or games that can be monetized for months or years after they are released, and the company began pressuring all of its projects to follow that route. “We tried,” said Herman. “Let’s make a narrative GAAS game. We were trying to make that make sense, and a lot of cool prototypes were made.”

>But nothing stuck. Over time, it became clear that Ubisoft had lost interest in their *Splinter Cell* game as the studio began talking about chasing *Call of Duty*. The project evolved several times and would eventually morph into *xDefiant*, an ill-fated shooter that was shut down a year after it came out.

>“It was exciting to go to work for the first six months because we thought we were going to be able to make something really great,” Herman said. “And then you realize that all of the things you care about, they don’t anymore. It’s a common thing in games.”

1owznbh,Is Skyrim still the open-world standard? Or what is it in your opinion?,gaming,1763134381.0,0,0,69,False,"I know Skyrim has aged, in some areas more noticeably than others. I've been having this crazy itch to start a fresh playthrough, and I did that yesterday, and I dropped a very happy 5 hours into the game. I struggle to replay games sometimes out of it being repetitive, I've started Skyrim countless times, and this time with a good 5 or 6 year gap, and I just had so much fun.

There are *CERTAINLY* some fantastic open-world games that have come out since then. Personally, my favorite, and it's a hot take, is Tears of the Kingdom, but even I can acknowledge where that world falls short.

What Skyrim's world does so well is REALLY encourage exploration. There is something to do literally constantly. Like Breath of the Wild / Tears of the Kingdom is a visual treat, there's not a lot to get side tracked with, and when you do, the rewards aren't always the best.

Where Skyrim nailed this process, is this excellently crafted rhythm of **side quest > leads to dungeon > leads to rewards / boss / special chest / ability > leads to dungeon exit > nearby cave / location on your compass**. You're coming off your high from the previous dungeon / cave and see another thing to tackle for more things. Maybe this dungeon has a little alchemy or enchanting table where you can mess with that for a minute. Hell, it might even have a full blown forge with materials and everything.  
Like there's ALWAYS SOMETHING leading into SOMETHING leading into SOMETHING and you're going halfway across the map in the wrong direction from the main quest because screw the main quest man, I need to find out what's in that GD cave. 

I know Skyrim is 14 years old now, (gag). But in terms of Bethesda games and the hate Bethesda has gotten in the last few years, it really has aged well. I think it truly set a fantastic standard that other open world games just don't exactly nail. Sure, there are absolutely elements of Skyrim that aren't amazing, there are probably mods that fix a majority of those issues nowadays.

Some competition might be FarCry and Assassin's Creed and WatchDogs, right? But in my opinion the Ubisoft cookie-cutter UI hand holding just gets boring. Cyberpunk probably comes close, but in my opinion it still lacks meaningful content. It IS a solid contender though.   
  
There are also some great open world games out there in general. I just think personally and specifically when it comes to the open world layout, design, exploration, streamlining of all those things, Skyrim might still take the cake for me, and I think I've just forgotten that over the last 10 years or so.

I own a laptop that is in the middle-high range for what a Gaming Laptop can be when i got it (January 2025) and even then i've had the rig reach outrageous or straightup dangerous temperatures while playing games much older than itself (looking at you, Greedfall).

Not only the game was released fully functional on day 1, but it also runs on Very High settings on my machine, that, according to CYRI, is not even in the recommended range for this game. I couldn't say that for any other game made after 2020, and even some older titles (I once again point my finger at Greedfall).

I shouldn't have to worry if i can run a game on a laptop that i bought this year, without the risk of 2nd degree burns.

So yeah, that's it, shoutout to Warhorse, keep charging on, i spent the last 8 hours glued to the screen, i'm dehydrated, starving and about to shit myself, but i just gotta write this because goddamn it's a shame that situations like this are rare gems and not a standard.",True,1201,0.89,108,1504,False

Game's worth a try imo. Simple TL;DR is fantasy 4x wizard wars with a relatively high game speed (campaigns cap out at 150 turns and I typically win around turn 70-80 with any of the win conditions). Main selling points are it turns into SRPG-style tactical combat with hero units that level and use equipment alongside soldiers when you fight, and extreme customization where you can make some wild builds work. Main weakness is that the game can often be something of a 'box of lego' experience where you assemble your build yourself out of whatever colored bricks you want, meaning things may be less flavorful and certainly less lore-rich than proper bespoke factions.

1ovyqxx,Ball X Pit Might be My Favourite Indie Game of the Year,gaming,1763033620.0,58,0,44,False,"So I ended up sinking 27 hours into this game this past week after thinking to just give it a quick try on Game Pass.

So, Ball X Pit is basically a type of rogue-like / rogue-lite and combination of old-school brick breaker games like Arkanoid, Vampire Survivors, Peggle and a few other new and nifty ideas. The gameplay itself is solid, having you fire balls up at enemies as you move through levels, but it’s everything that supports the gameplay that makes it so special. Like Vampire Survivors, you collect gems to level up and then pick from upgrades to create unique builds that help you reach the end of a level and its three bosses.

What really surprised me, though, was how much some of the unlockable characters, upgrades and systems change up the gameplay, and how each new level comes with its own challenges that suit different characters and playstyles. And yet, to add even more to the magic formula, Ball X Pit has great, addictive pacing thanks to a surprisingly fun town-building element.

What I really liked is that between rounds, you manage a little town area where you use your money and materials to build and upgrade structures that provide boosts, harvest materials or unlock new characters, because it really keeps progression interesting. Keeping with the theme of the game, you even send your characters out to harvest or build by strategically bouncing them around your town.

The loop of playing a level, sorting out your town, collecting your resources and jumping back in for another run is exactly what makes this game so dangerously addictive. It’s perfect for 10-minute sessions but somehow manages to hook you for hours, especially with how much the gameplay and management systems keep expanding over time.

I had a few bugs in the town/building parts of the game where the interfact would stop working and I had to restart the game, but the most recent patch fixed it so I've had no issues since.

Honestly, I like Ball X Pit more than I ever liked Vampire Survivors (although both are awesome). The gameplay is classic fun mixed with clever new concepts, and you’re not just at the mercy of random upgrades. I’ve loved playing Ball X Pit on Xbox, but it would be absolutely perfect on a handheld (I wish it had cross-saves).

1ovykbq,"Opinion: Sony is wise to release their latest live-service games only on Mobile/PC, not PS5",gaming,1763032958.0,0,0,17,False,"Yesterday, PlayStation announced two new live-service projects with third-party partners: **Ratchet & Clank: Ranger Rumble** (developed by Oh BiBi for mobile) and **Horizon: Steel Frontiers** (developed by NCSOFT for mobile and PC through the Purple emulator).

Naturally, this has sparked discussions about why neither game is coming to PS5, with some claiming it signals that Sony is “moving away from consoles.” Personally, I think it’s actually *smart* that they’re not launching these on PS5, at least not right now. Here’s why.

Over the past few years, PlayStation has gained a reputation (largely from its *own* fans) that it’s “chasing trends” with live-service games and “ruining” beloved IPs to do so. Every time a live-service title gets announced, sections of the PlayStation community immediately turn on it, calling it “live-service slop,” hoping it fails, and demanding Sony “go back to its roots.”

We saw this with *Marathon*, where fans complained it wasn’t single-player and gatekept it before it even launched. This hostility has become a real brand problem for PlayStation leadership.

They essentially have two choices:

1. Stop making live-service games altogether (which makes no business sense given that roughly 40% of gamers *only* play such games), or
2. Continue developing them, but release them *away* from the PlayStation ecosystem where the loudest resistance comes from.

That’s why I think these new games are launching on mobile and PC instead of PS5.

Of course, this shift has already created a *new* narrative: that Sony is “abandoning” its platform and core audience. But honestly, this is a *better* problem to have. By keeping these games off PS5 initially, Sony flips the psychology; instead of fans wanting them to fail, they’ll now start asking for PS5 ports. And when those ports inevitably happen, fans will be *grateful* to get them instead of resentful.

There are also practical reasons:

* These games are made by third-party partners, not PlayStation Studios.
* They’re clearly not on the same visual or technical level as *Rift Apart* or *Forbidden West*, and releasing them on PS5 could hurt the perceived quality of those IPs.
* Being heavily microtransaction-driven, they don’t really fit with PlayStation 5’s “premium” image.
* And finally, both IPs have *mainline* PS5 entries in development (*Insomniac* is working on another Ratchet, and *Guerrilla* reportedly has a Monster Hunter-style Horizon game coming). Oversaturating the PS5 with side projects could lead to fatigue.

So overall, I think Sony made the right call. Limiting these two games to mobile (and PC) keeps their console ecosystem clean, avoids backlash from their most vocal fans, and allows them to reintroduce these games later (on *their own* terms) if the demand is there.",True,0,0.15,91,2803,False

1ovv53g,A Major Mountain I designed in Minecraft Inspired by Denali,gaming,1763019862.0,760,0,39,False,"Mount Noraker (named after Foraker) stands as the current tallest mountain in my Minecraft world Sky Pixel, rising 1024 blocks high. I designed it to capture the raw power and isolation I felt in the Alaskan Range near Denali — an area where I filmed scenes for my indie film Harlow.

Denali, to me, has always been more than a mountain. It symbolized the emotional core of Harlow, themes of childhood trauma, mental health, and social isolation. I spent four years filming across the Pacific Northwest coast, where I was born and raised.

from Oregon to Alaska, these those landscapes influenced the way I built Mount Noraker particularly Denali.

I wanted it to feel inhospitable and untamed, like Denali itself felt when I stood at the base of the mountain. 

Noraker's base stretches roughly 3,000 blocks north-south and east-west, and it anchors the northern Alyeska Mountains, a desolate region on the far northwestern edge of Jesla Country in my world Sky Pixel. Nearby peaks within this glacial basin include Mount Dełá Ts’ina and Mount Sok’aan. The Ísjarn Dal Ice Fall, a massive valley ice fall, drops to nearly -500B below sea level, with surrounding mountains reaching 512B.

To bring Noraker to life, I pushed Bedrock to its absolute limits — sculpting jagged cliffs, carved glacial basins, and rough alpine ridges with WorldPainter and doing fine detailing in-game. I use high-end shaders such as BSL, Complementary, and Volumetric Fog to enhance the depth, atmosphere, and lighting.

I also have some design landscapes from Worldpainter outlining areas with several labeled glaciers (tł'oh, nakaih, kk'one) leading down toward the Koyukon Basin. Some of these terms were used by the Athabaskan people of Alaska, some images show locations / and peaks/ridges (red X's). As well as glacial drainage valleys (blue lines)

For ultra–high-fidelity renders, I work in professional 3D software where I can implement displacement mapping and subdivision surface modeling — techniques that add micro-detail and realistic surface texture beyond what the game engine can handle, I also use these programs for the hyper-realistic lighting and dramatic skies. These programs include Blender, Cinema 4D, and also I use Chunky, and Mineways to, depending on the shot.

Noraker is inspired off of Denali/Foraker. Not a replica. I took this approach because I wanted to keep my minecraft world Sky Pixel unique.

I just finished Expedition 33 and while I loved it to bits I can't lie that I've been getting open-world RPG fatigue. I've been looking online to find some unique open world games that don't have the traditional RPG loop of ""Go to place, find quest, complete quest, level up""

I want open world games where there's no levelling up or EXP. Progression is ability or gear gated.

Some examples of unique open-world games.

Death Stranding - Walking simulator, you progress by unlocking new items that make deliveries easier.

Shadow of the Colossus - This one is a bit weird, but I guess that's why I like it. It's basically linear but you can explore the map as you want in between the colossi.

MGS V - You progress by getting better guards for your home base and they make newer tech for you.

GTA 5 & RDR 2 - No real progression in these games besides unlocking new guns/vehicles as you go through the campaign.

Oldschool 3D zelda games - You earn items that let you explore more and more of the world and complete sidequests. You get stronger by finding heart pieces.

Outward - Haven't played it and frankly can''t get into it. But from online discussions this seems to be what I'm describing.

Sekiro - Progression is made only when you kill bosses.

Some examples of games I am not looking for. Keep in mind I love these games to bits but I'm just feeling levelling up fatigue. If i have to start one more character at ""level 1"" I'm gonna lose my mind.

The Witcher 3 - Perfect game, run around, find quests, fight enemies, level up

Newer AC Games 

Horizon Games

Bethesda Games

Cyberpunk

KCD 1 & 2

Souls games

  
Does anyone have any ideas?

If they’re not going to make games cheaper for our economy, fine… but at least make them cost the same as in the US. Instead, they end up more expensive here.

Quick examples:  
Black Ops 7 is around 90 dollars here.  
Hyrule Warriors is almost 95.  
The deluxe edition of Sparking Zero goes up to 110.  
We’ve even had games like Assassin’s Creed Mirage or some PlayStation exclusives costing more here than their base price abroad.

And when you compare that to what it means for someone in Colombia, it’s ridiculous.  
The average salary here is about 1.8 million COP, and the minimum is 1.3M. Buying a 90 dollar game means paying around 370,000 COP, which is like 25 percent of the average salary and over 30 percent of the minimum.

Meanwhile, in the US people paying 70 dollars there is around what 3%-5% percent of their monthly income?

So why is regional pricing ending up more expensive than the global price?

It’s pretty good. Nothing mind-blowing. But it’s a quality use of the premise of Mars colonization, and well worth the indie price tag. 

At least, it was. See, the game was more or less abandoned a year or so ago. That happens too, small game, small studio, life happens. But lately it’s become clear why, and it’s really, really gross. 

I don’t have the scoop on the publisher drama, but it’s clear Paradox (the publisher) got their mitts on it, decided to just abandon updates, and now they’ve announced a “relaunch” with no substantive changes.

I know people can custom design some amazing stuff in these games, but I'm not a designer so the default way things get plopped down and paths get made and all that, it just comes off incredibly ugly.  Then I just hate how little park management actually matters.  It seems like the game is more focused on driving a car to do menial tasks or flying a helicopter to do menial tasks, and waiting for a storm to come around so you can put people in a shelter and do a bunch of menial tasks.  There are gift shops and restaurants, but they seem a bit arbitrary.  Even the dinosaurs are a pain because maybe they're just too complicated or something.

Game Key Cards are Nintendo's way to have a retail presence... have a copy of a game that some can trade, lend or sell (instead of having a code in a box).

Nintendo is keeping their games on physical cards, but providing options shouldn't been seen as a negative. 

There is no perfect solution as other handhelds do not use carts. With a Steam Deck, an Xbox Rog Ally X, Legion Go, the only option is digital games with no retail presence. Nintendo has done what it can to appease physical gamers, specifically parents or children buying games at retail stores.

People get worried (which is fair) about Nintendo closing the servers in the future, making VGC worthless, but this is just assumption. It is the same situation as a digital game, and Nintendo has never shut down their servers. To this day you can still download your Wii games from the digital store.

1ota5rg,Arc Raiders makes me feel out of touch.,gaming,1762769852.0,5721,0,2323,False,"I bought Arc Raiders as my first extraction game, because I wanted to give the genre a try, and a lot of people have been saying it's arguably the most accessible game in the genre, plus it's been gaining tons of popularity and breaking it's concurrent player records constantly, so I figured this game had to basically be some sort of gaming phenomenon.

But after playing for honestly quite a few hours. I don't really get it? 

I've extracted maybe 40 times total now, and I think I've found literally one one interesting thing the entire time, a weapon blueprint. But it was a blueprint that requires a bunch of high level materials I've yet to even see. So it's basically useless. But then I thought to myself, why would I even waste my time building this weapon when someone is just going to hide around a corner, drop me in 2 seconds, and take it? 

And this ultimately made me realize, I just don't understand the appeal of this gameplay loop. You spend hours searching containers for rubber and metal, etc, and for what exactly? These games feel like when you buy a collectible knowing that if you remove it from its box it loses all its value, so it's better to just keep it on a shelf somewhere and admire its existence. 

I personally don't really get the feeling of ""loot anxiety"" for me it's just like ""oh I died, and lost that gun I wasted materials on, that's kinda lame, guess I'll just use the free crappy gun again.""

Like is that supposed to the appeal? The adrenaline rush youre supposed to get because you might lose something you spent hours crafting? I don't really get it I guess.

1ot6wsz,What would YOU want improved in a Resident Evil 5 remake?,gaming,1762757276.0,0,0,26,False,"There is one glaring wasted opportunity that, while perhaps a minor detail to some, REALLY rubbed me the wrong way in *R.E. 5* (I say that as someone who liked the game overall and beat it on co-op with a friend in high school). I don't care how people try to justify it with weak arguments like Jill being exhausted and needing rest after her fight with Chris and Sheva.

I don't care that Sheva was the 2nd playable character. I don't care that Jill *""assisted""* by tossing the rocket launcher. I don't care that this game was more about Chris's journey, with Sheva & Jill serving in supporting roles. I don't care about dismissive non-counters like *""People don't play these games for story, it's not that deep!""* (This is objectively false; Numerous players over the years have come to care about *R.E.*'s plot despite it never being high art).

THAT climactic finisher against Albert Wesker should've been fired by Chris and Jill together, ESPECIALLY considering that she was tortured the most by their enemy. Wesker was their former S.T.A.R.S. comrade, who revealed himself as a traitor and tried to murder them multiple times. Jill sacrificed herself to save Chris from being killed by him. Those OG heroes had gone through SO MUCH horror together over the years. Jill getting some long-awaited payback could've been her first step on the long road to recovery and moving forward.

Wesker violated her body as a guinea pig in his heinous experiments. At this point (2009), there were over 13 years of history between Jill, Chris, and Wesker. No disrespect or hate to Sheva, of course, but she'd never faced the guy before. She barely knew him. Thematically, she hadn't earned that big of a moment in my opinion. Her helping Chris finally kill one of the franchise's most iconic recurring villains fundamentally didn't leave as much of an impact on many fans, especially those who'd been waiting to see Jill in a main entry again for a decade.

Capcom and the devs should've had the common sense to know this and let Sheva take a backseat for five seconds to toss the rocket launchers instead. If they ever do remake 5, and they don't remedy this by giving Jill that kill shot alongside Chris, I guarantee that won't go over well. On the list of ways to improve on the original version, THIS is the most obvious no-brainer.

If we expand on this, before getting to the point of Jill making the climactic kill shot alongside Chris, I think the remake should also involve her in some way throughout the final boss battle leading up to that finale as support for the player/players. Ex- While Chris and Sheva fight Wesker on the ground in the volcano, Jill could show up starting at the second phase of the sequence in the helicopter equipped with a Minigun. It would be similar to Leon's helicopter support in *R.E. 4*, albeit with this chopper surviving.

Wesker would curse at his former slave, throwing debris at the chopper since it's too far out of his range to grab. Jill might snap back something to the effect of *""You should've KILLED me when you had the chance years ago! I'm NOT your prisoner anymore! Now, DODGE THIS, motherf\*\*\*er!""* When the transformed Wesker winds up one of his big tendril attacks that puts Chris & Sheva on the defensive to evade damage (or insta-kills), Jill could lay down suppressing fire from above, giving them an opening to move from behind cover.

During this short window, players can shoot back to shave off some of Wesker's health from his weak points while he's distracted by the chopper and throws more debris that forces it to circle back around. This cycle would repeat a few times until he's seemingly defeated after the Minigun's ammo runs out and he falls into the lava. Once the chopper gets close enough for Chris & Sheva to board, Wesker resurfaces and successfully grabs it in one last desperate attack. The scene plays out mostly the same as in the original game from here.

Except, Sheva gets the rocket launchers to Chris and Jill, and the reunited duo have one last brief stare-down with the monster their old adversary has become. I'm not sure what they'd say before pulling the trigger, but it shouldn't be something corny. Ex-*""You want S.T.A.R.S.? WE'LL give you S.T.A.R.S.!""* That line only worked with Nemesis, Jill shouldn't say it again here. It should be something simple, raw and realistic that feels worthy of a finale while expressing Jill's anger. The best idea off the top of my head is for Chris to yell, *""Your time's UP, you son of a b\*tch!!""* Jill has the last word: *""BURN- IN- HELL!!!""* Then, BOOM.

Goodbye and good riddance to Albert Wesker. As they fly off into the sunset, the panting Sheva thanks Jill for not using the rockets first. It would've been difficult for her & Chris to avoid getting caught in the explosions while they were down there. Jill replies, *""You're welcome...""*, humorously adding that the Minigun just made more sense for the opening act. Wesker was moving too fast back then for her to get a clean shot with the rockets. She couldn't risk wasting one in case they needed something big to finish him. Chris chuckles, complimenting Jill's judgment for being as sharp as ever, and the ending cutscene plays out.

[PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2286780/Aeruta/)

There has been a trend of games where you fight for ingredients and run a shop. The sprites got me into this one and I ended up sticking with it due to the charming cast and polished combat. The game is lighter on the management side of things than others and I like not having a million chores to do. It is more dialogue-heavy than most of its competition, but the text boxes go by fast.

# Vivid Knight

[PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569090/Vivid_Knight/), Switch, Mobile

I tend to drop auto-battlers pretty quickly, but this one managed to hold my interest. It's turn based which makes it easier to see how your strategy is working out. There is an ""upgrade"" system that makes use of duplicates, but upgraded units simply apply their traits after being removed rather than becoming stronger, so you'll end up shifting your team around rather than focusing on getting the most value out of a single strong unit.

# Road to Ballhalla

[PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/425410/Road_to_Ballhalla/), PS4, Xbox One

This is a rhythmic avoidance game similar to the Bound custom maps from the Starcraft UMS days. The maps are fun and there's not much more to say about it. If you're into the genre, you'll enjoy Road to Ballhalla.

[PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/529160/Moekuri_Adorable__Tactical_SRPG/)

I initially thought the tiles made the game look cheap, but then I realized the simple art allows the game to easily include terraforming effects. The game has an astounding amount of mechanics in addition to terraforming and allows for a very large assortment of strategies. It is also a game where strategy is important and not a braindead RPG with grid based movement.

# Kamifuda

This is a singleplayer deckbuilder in the vein of old school portable card video games like Pokemon TCG for Gameboy rather than modern rogue-lite stuff. That said, it feels like a puzzle game as the protagonist canonically rewinds time after losing to an opponent and builds a deck to counter their strategy. The gameplay is solid and I personally enjoyed the eldritch setting.

# Brave × Junction

[PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3364830/Brave_x_Junction/), PS5

While this is tagged as ""adults only"" on Steam, there's only 1 version and it's listed as Teen on the PlayStation store. The gameplay is Blackjack and whoever wins the round gets to deal damage. Each character has a variety of skills to skew the odds in your favour or deal more/take less damage. It's simple but way more fun than it has any right to be.

# I Am Fish

[PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1472560/I_Am_Fish/), Xbox One

It's a physics-based platformer in which you play as a fish and use various means of locomotion to escape captivity and reunite with your fish friends in open waters. It's reasonably challenging but not rage-bait; the mechanics aren't weird or wonky. Simple, but fun.

# Disc Room

[PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229580/Disc_Room/), Xbox One, Switch

This is like a bullet hell but without monsters to fight, so more of a bullet survival. While the core gameplay is simple the game includes a ton of gimmicks to make the content feel sufficiently varied.

# Crown Trick

[PC](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1000010/Crown_Trick/), PS4, Xbox One, Switch

In this roguelike there is a boss after every main floor, so you can both plan around them and not worry about having to grind your way through several floors to stumble upon one. Minor mobs have a ton of gimmicks to keep things interesting but go down quickly so fighting your way through them doesn't become a slog. This is a solid roguelike that doesn't overstay its welcome.

These corporations have become so fixated on profits and the stock market that they forgot that the gaming industry is primarily an entertainment industry. If people have an option to play something better (and in this case cheaper) they will.

So we see that happening right now. I think it's a total of 6 ""Indie"" games in the past 4 weeks that sold a combined total of 8 million copies. Developers are seeing what corporations now lack in their video games: Passion.

The mass layoffs for short term profits are encouraging these talented developers to form smaller teams that simply make good games. And we're all going to play them in substitute of the AAA slop that gets thrown at us with pushy microtransactions and addictive, manipulative strategies we're growing privy to.

1ospk8a,[OC] 6 scales of video game complexity for beginner gamers (infographic),gaming,1762710175.0,3690,0,441,False,"Inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/metroidvania/comments/1os2a15/the_sliding_scale_of_exploration_guidance/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), I decided to rank video games in 6 different scales of complexity.

The idea is to help people who are trying to get into gaming, but consider it to be too daunting to learn at first (if you have watched Razbuten's series on ""gaming for non-gamers"", you know what I'm talking about). People can use this scale to help them find games that are not too hard for them to learn how to play.

The thing is that this learning complexity may be separated into multiple axes, given that some people may struggle more with some things (e.g. quick reflexes) and some people may struggle with others (e.g. moving the character and the camera at the same time).

Thus, I have separated game complexity into 6 axis. Each game could be placed in a location within each of the 6 axis:

1. How hard the game's challenges are to beat

2. How much the game requires fast reaction times

3. How much the game demands moving the character and the camera at the same time

4. How many buttons the game requires

5. How complicated the game mechanics are to understand

6. How much the game guides you towards the objectives

The idea would be for beginner gamers to start with games which are low in all 6 scales, and slowly progress up through each of the 6 scales until they are capable of playing almost everything.

 would be also quite helpful if we had some kind of guide or app that lets people classify popular games in these 6 criteria, and then it would recommend games to beginner gamers to progress through them. I don't have time to build such a thing, so if anyone wants to steal the idea and make it, feel free to do so.",False,3690,0.89,72,1826,True

1or6gt5,Ghost of Yotei is the most well crafted bad game I've ever played.,gaming,1762549980.0,0,0,84,False,"Might just be sick of open world game design but the game is just filled with monotonous garbage.

It's incredibly pretty, and it's at least not frustrating to play but it's genuinely not fun.

Main critiques:
-tired open world design. 1 million things to do on the map and none of it is thst compelling or fun. Follow a fox for five minutes. Climb up a mountain that isn't challenging in any way. Get into the same boring fights

-combat. (This might be a personal preference  situation) it's annoying when games force you to block or parry in order to damage enemies. Blocking and parrying should be imo options in combat that reward timing and mastery but not requirements. Every fight ends up being using a quick fire tool or just sitting around waiting to parry or guard break in order to get lethal damage. It's border line lock and key game play and it sucks. It's time gating with extra steps. 

-combat (part 2). Actual lock and key gameplay. The weapon selection system to counter other weapons is just boring. And the controls for swapping don't feel great. Tons of times where I think i swapped weapons but I didn't give it enough time or something. If you don't use the correct weapon you seem to be heavily penalized. Combat is so boring that I usually choose stealth options to avoid having to fight. Boss fights exaggerate the issue because they are so long. 

Additionally the fact that enemies basically warp towards you with attacks there is no maintaining spacing in a fight. If an enemy queues up an attack it will hit you if you dont block parry or dodge. Your are basically never just out of range of an attack. It just forces you into one way to play.

-writing/ story. Also personal preference but I think it's just genuinely bad. There is so much dialog in this game that doesn't matter. Characters just talking with 0 consequence. And it's such a long game it ends up wasting so much of your time talking to a random npc about how they've been wronged so go kill a bunch of dudes. I don't know how anyone plays the game without wanting to skip everything they can. Other people have talked about how it's just a boring revenge plot. It is but what makes this worse is all the characters are so boring and dont have any interesting perspectives or character traits. Whole things feels undercooked, which is weird because there is so much writing in the game. They clearly spent alot of time on this.

Closing thoughts:
The game is really pretty and clearly a lot of time and effort went into it but it's amazing how under cooked and tired it's design is. I had similar issues with it's predecessor ghost of tsushima but it seems exaggerated in yotei.  It's just not fun and a chore to play, but again really pretty to look at.

1oqxug8,My cousin worked at a multiplayer studio that kept saying “we’ll let players adapt” even when the game broke.,gaming,1762530346.0,2281,0,139,False,"So my cousin used to work at a mid-sized multiplayer studio-  not naming names, but let’s just say it sits on a Mountaintop.

Their whole brand was “community-driven development.”
They loved to talk about how players shape the game through playtests.
Except… the “community input” was really just free QA.

Every patch would drop with balance issues that the devs already knew about.
Weapons overpowered, broken maps, matchmaking busted, and every time my cousin’s team raised it, management said the same thing:

“We’re not fixing it this sprint. The players will adapt.”

That became the company’s unofficial motto.
Queue delays? They’ll adapt.
Hackers everywhere because anti-cheat is asleep? Adapt.
Servers down during peak hours? Adapt.

Meanwhile, devs were killing themselves with late-night fixes that never got approved, because leadership didn’t want to “confuse the data” from playtests.
Translation: metrics > gameplay.

The worst part? A known exploit went live for three consecutive patches.
Players literally made a meme out of it. YouTubers roasted the studio.
When someone from the design team begged to push a hotfix, management shut it down because there was a “community showcase” event coming up and “we can’t afford bad optics.”So instead of patching, they ran influencer tournaments on a broken build.
And when players complained? The boss told the dev team,

“Don’t argue, just remind them we value feedback.”

My cousin said there was even a private Slack channel called #please-dont-mention-the-bugs.

The game’s population tanked. Players blamed the devs, not realizing the people who actually could fix things weren’t allowed to touch them.

So yeah, next time you see a studio post “we’re listening to the community,”
just remember: someone in a meeting probably said,

""Hey everyone, R* Employee of many years here!

 

Understandably I want to remain anonymous due to retaliation from the Company, but I may be willing to verify I'm an employee with @Spider-Vice via DM (if required). I am also a member of the Union.

 

I've been reading a lot of the discussion on here and elsewhere about the firing of more than 34 of my colleagues last week (31 in the UK + 3 in Canada) and have seen a lot of disinformation and lies that are really concerning. Particularly concerning how so many folk are willing to believe the Company's excuses.

 

Last week, my colleagues who were in the studio were each individually messaged by HR for a short friendly meeting, under the friendly guise of ""Hey, are you free for a quick chat?""

 

Upon attending this meeting they were handed an envelope with a short letter stating that their employment had been terminated for ""gross misconduct"" regarding posts made in Discord.

 

They failed to provide any evidence when asked, nor was any stated in the letter. And did not divulge any other information or reasoning - ""and no other reason""

 

They refused their right to Union representation in the disciplinary meeting (which is against UK employment law) and were frogmarched out of the studio with the meeting lasting less than 5 minutes.

 

For colleagues who were not in the Studio that day, they received a phone call from HR that lasted less than 2 minutes telling them they were fired and that they'd receive the same letter as above. I am aware of one employee who had a panic attack at this moment, and HR hung up on them during this panic attack not caring at all about their wellbeing.

 

These colleagues of mine were hard workers who have spent many many years at R* in critical roles. With colleagues who have been at R* for more that 18 years and none of them have ever had a disciplinary in that time. They are not easily replaced and will certainly affect us in making our project deadlines.

 

These are very senior artists, animators, QA testers, designers, programmers and producers. Including Leads. All super talented people who were proud of their work over multiple R* titles, and all they wanted was the best for R* and their fellow colleagues.

 

Some of these members were off sick, recovering from surgery or on paternity leave. Fired without pay, losing their careers and putting them into hardship in the lead up to Christmas, and even potentially losing their VISAs to work in the UK. 

 

Let me make this clear! I never saw any discussion/leaking of Rockstar projects in the Union Discord. The only ever discussion was around unionisation efforts and the working conditions at R*. The Discord wasn't public. It was a private Discord group that only contained R* employees and the IWGB Union officials.

 

This was Union Busting and nothing else! Everyone fired was a Union Member, they were also predominantly from those who were on the Union Organising Committees of each UK studio.

 

Just one week before, the Union had reached ~200 members taking us over the 10% threshold required to seek recognition and begin engaging in collective bargaining. Allowing us to negotiate directly with management on the key issues that affect us: worsening crunch, inadequate pay and inflexible working arrangements.

 

They have fired over 34 of us now. There were over 250 of us in that Union/Employee Discord group. There is the fear that if they get away with this, they'll have nothing stopping them from doing this again and again.

Those of us who are lucky and remain for now work in fear! Fearful when talking to each other at the tea prep, fearful that we're next in line and are easily got rid of, too scared to go outside the studio and talk to (or even acknowledge) our colleagues outside protesting in fear of reprisals. Morale in the studio is at rock bottom. When we should be excited about what's to come over the next year we are now totally deflated and our trust and confidence in others is totally shot.

 

Which is the truly heartbreaking part, as for us in the Union, all of our ambition was to make R* a happier, fairer, safer and more equitable place. That's all. What has happened clearly shows that we care more about the wellbeing of our colleagues at Rockstar than the Company does.

 

The union remains unbowed and is fighting to win the reinstatement of every dismissed member of staff at Rockstar through legal means and campaigning. 

 

This fight is critical, if Rockstar can get away with this, they will keep treating their workers with disdain, disrespect, and subjecting them to continued illegal treatment.

 

Thanks for your time, and I hope this is some truth that helps you all understand what's going on here at the moment.

 

I you would be so kind, you can contribute to the fundraiser to support those fighting their dismissal here: https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/support-rockstar-workers-fighting-unfair-dismissals/

 

It would be really appreciated if you could also share the above link. I won’t be cross posting this to other forums, but please feel free to share.

your age (approx.)

do you always invert y-axis?

why/how do you have that preference?

I’m 50s, and prefer to invert in pretty much every game for both mouse and controller. I think (and I’m told by the internet) that it’s because I started playing games when the old-school joystick was in use and playing flight sim games with that.

Today I was starting a new game and wondered if the only reason “invert y-axis” still exists is for gen-x and older millenial gamers, or if there’s more to it than “we grew up playing flight sims with a joystick”, and younger gamers do it too.

Edit: /u/jtho78 (and /u/SailorJerrry ) posted this article talking about a scientific study done on this topic. From the article:
“In short, gamers think they are an inverter or a non-inverter because of how they were first exposed to game controls. Someone who played a lot of flight sims in the 1980s may have unconsciously taught themselves to invert and now they consider that their innate preference; alternatively a gamer who grew up in the 2000s, when non-inverted controls became prevalent may think they are naturally a non-inverter. However, cognitive tests suggest otherwise. It’s much more likely that you invert or don’t invert due to how your brain perceives objects in 3D space.”

TLDR: IMO, a good game gave me some fun. What is your definition?

-----

With more details, for me, this is what I expected for a game to be good. 

Good doesn't mean perfect, it doesn't mean an immediate classic. It could have a lot of default, or none. An excellent game is good in general, and a buggy game could still be kind of good. And mostly: a good game **cannot** please everyone!

For me, a games is good as long as I have fun with it. May it be because of the gameplay, the story or the beautiful art and sceneries; all of which that makes me enjoy my time with the game (be it with a sad or happy tones). May it be a flash game or an AAAA game; a very narrative or a gameplay focused game.

I feel like nowadays, we doesn't want games to be good, we want them to be PERFECT, and you cannot have fun if it is not. And don't even expect having fun on a 13/20 game, or in a game where John Doe said they didn't like the character design. If someone doesn't like the game, it cannot be good for anybody.

Maybe I'm too nice with games, but I feel like a game doesn't need to be a potential goty to be good

Cyberpunk was bunged as shit at launch, but it still is a good game to play. Hogwarts Legacy universe come from the mind of a transphobic person, but it is a good play. FIFA and CoD are always the same shit, but gamer have a good moment playing them. Pokémon games are created with only a few pennies and not enough cares compared to the fortune Pokémon Compagnie have and could invest, owning the biggest franchise on earth. But you can still have fun with the little monsters

1oq24ug,I could make you the best game in the world,gaming,1762443424.0,0,0,51,False,"I don't understand why the best game in the world doesn't exist yet. I mean, yes, some games exist and are loved by the whole world for their near-perfection. And obviously I know it's a subjective matter, so you cannot make everyone 100% happy. But still. There are some of those games that are loved by a very vast majority of players who played them, like :

Zelda Ocarina of Time

Elden Ring

Expedition 33

Hollow Knight

Outer Wilds

Red Dead Redemption 2

All these games are considered as master pieces in their own category for the passion that has been poured in their development.

Especially Expedition 33, which is a prime example of what you get when you just take good ideas from other games and put them in one single game, play them, like what you made, and then release it.

As a player for now around 33 years, I'm deeply passionate about video games and I love to understand how they are made, what is good, what is not, what can be improved, and I always search in the smallest details of gameplay, feeling, sound, graphics, etc... to see what could be improved or not. And by doing that, I can determine features that would simply add fun to the game.

Let's take the example of Elden Ring : once you finished the game, you can replay NG+ as much as you want, but it's always a linear experience. What if there was a randomizer to spice up your future runs ? What if you just added a boss rush mode ? It doesn't seem impossible to do, since people make mods in that regard. These two options would drastically increase the fun time you can have on such a game. Lords of the Fallen 2023 did it, they included a randomizer in their game after an update (shoutout to them for that). From Software could, but they won't. Why ? 

Also sometimes we see games releasing with a lot of potential, but this potential ends up not being exploited at all. Number one game for this is Dragon's Dogma 2. The level of cope on their subreddit (i'm part of it lol) is too damn high. They hope for a DLC that will probably never release.

Yes, I know, there are some money considerations to have, but some people show us that money can be put out of the equation if you take your time and pour all of your passion in the game you are making. Silksong is a pretty good example of a game where devs just made their dream game, without compromise. They released a game according to their own vision, without constraint.

And obviously, all of these games are a mix of ideas that previously existed in previous games. Elden Ring is the grand child of Zelda Ocarina of Time in terms of gameplay with the lock-on feature and the general slow action gameplay. All of the souls games that came before are also what made Elden Ring such a GOAT. Michael Zaki and From Software had a VISION (this word is important) and they kept that vision all throughout development, to obtain the best possible game in the end (for them, as it's still possible to enhance it as I said before with mods and such).

Therefore I assume that if I had the means to have a team of people as passionate as me, I could be the game designer of the best game ever. I could put everything I like from every game I loved, but all in one single game. My game would have the things I find the most fun and addictive, my game would NOT have the things that everyone agrees to hate, my game would feel and sound crispy, crunchy and yummy. I see no reason why I should restrain the game design of my game other than money.

Let's say that for some reason I have, indeed, the money and the team to do the game I want (and many other people actually want too). What would I do ?

The answer is Expedition 33. I think it's the demonstration of passionate people using all the tools we have in modern times to make the game they loved. And it's beautiful to see how fun and good their game can be when they don't have stupid marketing people deciding for them, or stupid deadlines ruining the release of the game. It's just guys who think like me, who went like ""let's make the BEST turn based rpg ever, guys"". Let's go.

So I hope in the future, more people will do the same, since we have the tools for this nowadays, and there is obviously a LOT of money available to finance these things. Right now, where the money is flowing the most, is where the minds are rotten. Blizzard, EA, Ubisoft, all of those dead companies are just slaves to marketing people. But studios who can stay free from those schackles now have the means to do these games. If concerned editors rise in this scenario, editors who can actually finance true passion, then we are blessed with a very bright future for video games.

Anyway thanks for reading all of this.

1oppx90,Borderlands 4 Casual Gamer Review,gaming,1762404794.0,0,0,26,False,"7/10

 

I am not the hardcore gamer type. I’ve played video games my entire life, but always for fun. I feel like there’s a lot of gamers out there like me who mostly just lurk this sub like I have done for the past many years but never post anything, and I hope to speak to them with this. Also, I posted a TLDR at the bottom if you want the short of it. I don't spoil any major plot points in here, but as always if you don't want to be spoiled at all, don't read this.

 

Let me just start with this: I am a huge Borderlands fan. I’ve played all of the Borderlands games from start to finish, though I’ve enjoyed some more than others. I’m one of the people in the minority that genuinely very much enjoyed Borderlands 3, even with all of its….not good dialogue. The gameplay though? It was such a huge step up for me from Borderlands 2 that it really sucked me in. I also played a good amount of Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands. It didn’t click with me at first, but eventually I ended up enjoying it enough for what it was. Anyways, Borderlands 4.

 

Gameplay: Easily the strongest point of the game, the combat is incredibly satisfying and rewarding. I have done two play-throughs now (first was with Harlowe, second with Rafa) and I enjoyed both of the characters for different reasons.  I tried multiple builds for each and while enjoying all of them, it did feel to me that some are just way stronger than others. The movement, grappling hook and jetpack all come together seamlessly most of the time to create that feeling of being the baddest of the bad in the firefight. My only complaint here is that at times it felt like I would get stuck after using a dash and leave myself in bad situations. But I also kinda think that’s fair. Git gud and all that.

 

Story: For the most part, I enjoyed the story. Nothing overly complicated or deep, but definitely a more serious tone than Borderlands 3. There’s a big bad, he’s got 3 big henchman you must take out, and there’s a twist. I enjoyed the characters for the most part, although at times some of them felt a little underdeveloped. The returning characters were great but I miss some of the manufacturers. I do hate having to slowly walk behind characters as they give exposition, and that is something you’ll just have to get used to in this game. So boo on that. Sometimes you can run to the next objective early, but sometimes you have to wait for them to finish their spiel to give you something, you just never know.

 

Side quests and collectibles: The side quests are awesome, and some of the collectibles are fun…but there really are just so  many. It’s a large map with lots of stuff to find, so if you’re into that, you’re gonna have a great time. If not, I would say probably turn down the difficulty a bit so you can run through the story without needing all of the experience from the side quests. 

 

Guns and Loot: Now this is what the game is all about right? Getting guns that really fit your playstyle and causing maximum damage. There were times during this game that I’d have four different guns I loved all at once, and I’d just cycle through them fight to fight on a whim. However, after a while those guns would be too weak, and I’d find myself at a point where none of my guns felt fun anymore. So you change it up, and then you end up trying guns that you don’t like. For example, I genuinely don’t understand why you’d use a lot of the torque weapons that shoot the slower rockets. You can’t hit anyone at range because the enemies are constantly moving. As for sniper rifles, why use anything other than a Jacobs that gives massive damage per shot without having to reload each time? If anyone out there uses a Maliwan sniper, please explain...I don't understand them. Most of the guns are great, and the unique guns always bring something fun and different which makes for some great moments. As for loot, if you’re playing on anything under hard, you’re going to be disappointed.

 

Technical Stuff: Now look I’m not a game dev or anything like that so I generally will give passes to games that don’t run perfectly if they’re fun to play. But if you quit playing BL4 because you couldn’t deal with the massive amount of bugs? Completely understand. Here’s a list of what I’ve dealt with: 1) the game loses frames the longer you play it…I don’t really know how to justify this it really sucks. 2) Sometimes during quests, you will be forced to “Clear all forces” or whatever, and one of those guys will somehow clip through the environment and you have to close the game and restart it to redo the entire fight and hope it doesn’t happen again….incredibly infuriating. 3) since the newest patch, if I put my PS5 in rest mode with the game still open, I will receive an error message and the game will close when I try to get back in. So I’m forced to close the game every time I decide I’m done playing, which really isn’t that big of a deal, but I definitely shouldn’t have to do it. 4) as a lot of people have said, the map is terrible, giving useless routes when you ping where you’re trying to go, which is rather annoying.

 

All in all, I really do love this game. I hope some things are fixed, but it will be a game I return to when I’m not feeling anything else for quite a while.

>ARC Raiders has well and truly been worth the wait. This is a phenomenal showcase of what immersive multiplayer can be. Every run is different, and your squad will come out with stories to tell each time. It can be tougher on those planning to play solo, and the extraction loop won't be for everyone. But as far as extraction shooters go, this is one of the most accessible, and it respects your time, giving you a fun experience from your first match. We can easily say that ARC Raiders is one of the best multiplayer games this generation.

1opb4gg,"[IGN] Inside Dante’s Purgatorio, the Cancelled Sequel to EA’s Dante’s Inferno | The game was penned by Assassin’s Creed 2 co-writer Joshua Rubin as a battle between Heaven and Hell",gaming,1762367773.0,361,0,52,False,"The article is incredibly thorough about the *entire* script of the game's 11 levels: **Level 1: Dream in Eden , Level 2: At the Shores of Purgatory , Level 3: Ante-Purgatory , Levels 4 and 5: Pride / Envy , Level 6: Wrath , Levels 7, 8, and 9: Sloth, Greed, and Gluttony , Level 10: Lust , Level 11: The Garden of Eden**

\- The entirety of Inferno 2’s campaign is set on Mount Purgatory. Described by Knight as the “inverse of Hell,” this mountain is divided into nine tiers – or terraces – themed after the Seven Deadly Sins of Pride, Envy, Wrath, Sloth, Greed, Gluttony, and Lust, with a giant gate at its cliffside base and the Garden of Eden at its seemingly unreachable summit. Each terrace acts as a campaign stage, complete with its own challenges, puzzles, enemies, and Vision Cave (more on those later.)

\- For the sequel, Dante would once again be outfitted with his cross, which can smite foes with blasts of Holy energy, and a scythe. While this scythe would have looked and felt distinct from the one used in the first game, the developers didn’t want them to be too different. “Dante’s Inferno players really liked the weapon,” a former Visceral employee explained, “which could expand and retract and swing around like Kratos’ blades of Chaos. We’d built a dedicated combat team that actually included people who worked on God of War, so we knew we shouldn’t try to completely reinvent the wheel.”

\- Complimenting these weapons would be a suite of new spiritual abilities, which Dante acquires throughout the campaign. The first is Spirit Jump, a skill that allows him to leap across vast distances. Following that, he learns to take control of enemies (Possession), avoid certain attacks (Spirit Dodge), run at high speeds (Spirit Dash), and – during major boss fights – sprout angelic wings that allow him to fly. To use these and other powers, the player must fill up their “Faith Meter,” which allows them to enter “Spirit Mode,” a power-up that transforms Dante into an ethereal version of himself.

\- Dante, too, must redeem himself if he wishes to reach Eden. To that end, each terrace sees Dante and Virgil search for a “Vision Cave”, where Dante relives an episode from his past in which he gave in to one of the Seven Deadly Sins.

\- Scriptwriter Joshua Rubin says he envisioned these caves as “playable cutscenes” inspired by immersive theater productions like Sleep No More. “Dante – in Spirit Mode – moves through his memories like a ghost, reliving moments of sin that shaped his love story with Beatrice back in Florence,” he explains. At the end of these gameplay sequences, Dante fights “grotesque” personifications of his sins, literally defeating the demons inside him.

Upon exiting each Vision Cave, you would have received a power-up from Lucia, followed by an opportunity to make a gameplay choice that signifies Dante’s moral growth. On the Terrace of Envy, for example, you would have been able to risk your life to save an NPC, thus demonstrating compassion, envy’s opposite.

Traversal would have played a much bigger part in this game than it did in the original. According to one former Visceral employee, “Probably the most innovative and interesting thing we wanted to do with Purgatory, which is about ascending up to Heaven as opposed to descending down into Hell, was the climbing. Jonathan \[Knight\] told us: ‘I want this to be the best climbing game out there, better than Uncharted or Tomb Raider.’ Unlike those games, where pushing the stick glued you to a wall, we wanted to keep you on \[your\] toes and instill a real sense of vertigo.”

Climbing segments would have been akin to puzzles, with the player searching for graspable ledges, avoiding crumbling rocks and ranged enemy attacks, and helping companion characters ascend along with you. Midway through the campaign, Dante would have unlocked an ability that reveals previously unseen “Angelic Architecture,” structures normally visible only to angels and redeemed souls, opening up new routes through the environment.

**Visceral planned for Dante’s Inferno 2 to include co-op and multiplayer modes. These were included out of necessity – as one former employee puts it, “This was a time when every game needed to have DLC and online play because companies were afraid of people selling their discs back to GameStop” – and partly out of a desire to build on the foundation of Trials of St. Lucia, a DLC pack for the first game which added battle arenas that could be played co-operatively with another player.**

**Although work on co-op and multiplayer had hardly gotten off the ground when EA pulled the plug, employees recall that the modes would have followed an angels-versus-demons format, with players being able to fight for either side. One employee had vague recollections of a map where players had to defend and board airships.**

-Very well crafted open world with some solid and rewarding exploration and resource gathering/crafting without feeling tedious. Side missions are crafted care and make sense instead of being cookie cutter box checkers. 


-Well paced progression as you slowly become more powerful and capable of taking on hordes thanks to some well designed variety of combat options. 


-Combat offers numerous strategies as you go, from traps, custom melee weapons, explosives(exploding knives are so so satisfying), to guns that give you just enough ammo to use now and then when you really need them. 


-Melee mechanics feel really nice and enemy variety is solid considering it’s either zombies or the occasional group of humans. It’s simple but feels great. Aiming for body parts works well as the controls are accurate and there are some brutal finishers. Not the to the same degree as Dead Island 2 but it gets the job done. 


-Level and world design are really impressive. There are a lot of buildings to explore, both small and large, some underground areas, open spaces, etc.  


-Parkour mechanics are great, and getting around the world doesn’t take too long. If you need to travel longer distances it’s it too hard to find a car. 


-Beast mode is satisfying without being too overpowered. 


-World size feels perfect and the setting feels refreshing.

Nothing anyone has put any real effort into, at least.

For those that weren't around; this arcade game was a phenomenon and likely a large reason why the show became as popular as it did in the first place. It was a technical marvel at the time and set a standard for how to treat a popular IP with respect.

That last part is the thing that sparks my intrigue as an adult. How did this Japanese company barely anyone knew (relatively speaking) at the time come out of nowhere and nail the aesthetic and overall soul of the most popular IP of the 90's so damned well?

This was before the proliferation of internet. What did that kind of collaboration even look like?

This game seems to be something of a marvel to me. Two things:

1. I did not realize this thing was in creation during the [first season](https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/The_Simpsons_Arcade_Game?utm_source=chatgpt.com), according to some conversations I've seen. This makes me more curious about what the creators wanted from the IP in general.
2. Related to 1: I was in my preteens when this game was released in Arcades, and as such, I think it's been verified by Einstein that there's some kind of time dilation effect that happens during this stage of a person's life - because it felt like ""The Simpsons"" as a franchise had been around *forever at this point*, before I first ran into that Arcade Machine for the first time at ""The Palace"" skating rink all those years ago.

I really need a thorough behind-the-scenes documentary on this thing. Someone please get on this!

\*edit\*

Imagine how fucking pathetic you have to be as a human being for wanting to straight shit on someone that just wants to express excitement for talking about the Simpsons due to one throwaway line. The tone of some of these comments are fucking unreal.

These days, I struggle to get hooked on modern titles the same way I did back then.

I spend most of my gaming time using emulators on PC, and while that should scratch the itch, it doesn’t quite do it. Emulators can be hit or miss — some games run beautifully, while others are a complete mess. On top of that, tracking down certain games is a pain. Most of the companies that made them don’t sell them anymore, resellers jack up the prices, and thanks to internet censorship, even finding “free” options is getting harder.

Sony and Microsoft at least make an effort to bring some sixth-gen titles to modern platforms — not all, but a fair few.

Nintendo, on the other hand, will just pick a random game or two, slap an anniversary label on it, and charge a ridiculous amount.

However, as time went by, most games implemented shooting mechanics (GTA, uncharted, TES), so playing strictly FPS games didn't feel needed anymore.

However, right now, I'm feeling like playing one. 

For reference, things that I like:   
- Realism: I prefer games that feel real. If I shoot someone in the head, I expect them to stay dead. I'm not a big fan of games like doom, where you have to kill the Lord of Hell, and 200 bullets to his head aren't enough to kill him. Also, a game where I can only take a few shots before dying, because I'm playing a normal guy, without superpowers.   
- Story: I'm looking for a game where I am fighting a war that makes sense. I'm not looking for shooting just for the sake of shooting.   
- Tactics: a game that rewards thinking, rather than shooting millions of bullets. However, a few fast-paced sections sometimes are fine.

Parents and kids will come to your door.  If it's one to four kids, you anxiety meter is fine.  It's a whole group of parents with five to twelve kids, your anxiety meter will fill steadily.  When they leave, your anxiety meter will go down slowly.  However, if your anxiety meter gets too high, you'll freak out, run into your house, bolting it and shutting off the front porch light.  

You must also keep track of how much candy you are giving out.  If you run out while more kids are coming, you'll also freak out, lock up the house and shut off the lights, and run to your room.

If you are able to keep calm and manage your candy well, you'll be fine.

All three scenarios that I have listed will have a similar ending with you going to your room and do your annual viewing of Hocus Pocus hoping this year that the Sanderson Sisters will win even though you know they won't.  It's how you've handled things that determines how well you enjoy your viewing, though.

Oh, and there's some freaky dude that you catch watching you every so often.  If it turns 8 'o clock, you have a high anxiety meter and little candy left, he will appear right in front of your face saying ""Do I scare you?""  You have two responses - 1) say yes and get a jump scare that gives your character a heart attack and dies or 2) have your character verbally lash out at the creature by saying ""NO!  NO, YOU DON'T SCARE ME!  I FACED A BUNCH OF LITTLE KIDS WITH GIANT EYES LOOKING UP AT MY 5'10"" 350 LBS MALE PATTERN BALDNESS ASS IN APPREHENSION FOR THE LAST TWO HOURS!  I HAVE FACED MY FEAR!

1ol6n49,"The sad state of ""Junk car, survival, life simulators""",gaming,1761945703.0,0,0,26,False,"My Summer Car is one of the greatest games ever made. Beneath it's admittedly modest presentation lays a diamond in the rough. Many games let you fix cars and many games let you drive cars but few games let you do both. But it's not just a survival/life simulator game. It's a unique game with great humor that oozes with charm. And it's all made by one guy, which is very impressive. It also somewhat justifies the less than great visual presentation, which to be honest contributes to the game's unique feel. 

There was definitely a good idea there, and one that could be expanded on. Surely enough not long after discovering My Summer Car I discovered another game in the same vein called Jalopy. Much like MSC it too featured a gameplay loop centered around keeping a pile of junk alive, but it expanded on the idea by featuring procedurally generated maps and a bigger focus on story telling. A great, though admittedly short, experience. But fret not, for there was so much that could be done with the groundwork laid, and surely enough games were coming out left and right iterating on the idea and expanding it. All we had to do was just wait for the genre to come into its own. 

And nearly ten years on, it's never really gotten better than that. A quick glance on Steam for simillar games and you're showered with copy cats and clones of pretty much just the two games I mentioned. Some are ok, basically just more of a good thing. Most, however, are just abandoned early access projects with unfulfilled promises and reduced scopes. All way past their full release deadlines, all scaling back down on their initial plans, pretty much none truly expanding on the formula in any particular way. While there are some gems in there, as in games that offer a decent experience, none are really surpassing MSC or Jalopy in what they offer. Jalopy clones are really bad, since the nature of the game means that they're little more than procedurally generated slop with more and more low effort assets dumped into them periodically. MSC clones are even worse, with some standouts like Mon Bazou existing, but there's always some compromise being made. Some look downright horrible despite being fun to play if you get past that. Some are just aimless, with none of the charm or purpose that made MSC great, some are just straight up copies. You can only brew moonshine and run rallies so many times before it gets boring. 

I guess I'm just venting here. I understand that most of these games are single person projects and it's an uphill battle to bring a project like that to completion, but I can't help but feel sad that games like MSC and Jalopy gave me an itch I can't scratch. Despite seemingly being interest in the genre, no one has actually come around to fill that demand. I recently played Junkyard Truck which was cool and all for a few hours but I soon realised that what I was playing was more or less what we're getting. Dev has no real plans to expand the game much further and it's not long after you get over the early game that you find yourself to be roaming aimlessly.

1okkhkz,The Outer Worlds 2 - A mixed review after the first 15 hours,gaming,1761882141.0,139,0,209,False,"I went into The Outer Worlds 2 with optimism. I wasn’t a huge fan of the first game even tough I finished it. TOW2 tries a bit too hard with the “comedy,” feels kind of bland overall, and the combat leans too much into bullet spongy enemies for my taste. Still, I was curious to see if Obsidian would take things up a notch later.

Unfortunately, even though The Outer Worlds 2 is technically better than the first, it’s not much of a step up. It still lags behind Obsidian’s older games in terms of storytelling, character writing, and quest design. The world just doesn’t have that spark, it feels like a prettier (but not that pretty) version of what we already got. I think I liked what they did with Avowed better.

The gameplay is definitely smoother, and I can’t deny it’s a solid classic-style RPG where you can build your character and approach quests however you want. There’s a certain charm to the setting and tone, and when it clicks, it does remind me why Obsidian is still respected in the RPG space.

But overall, it feels very formulaic. The factions, the choices, the open ended perks and weaknesses,it all funnels toward the same kinds of outcomes, and it never really surprises you. The humor still feels forced, and the story doesn’t grab you the way it should.

In a year full of great RPGs, I just can’t justify spending or money on something that feels this familiar. It’s not bad just uninspired. But I already have Gamepass and no other game on my list at the moment which is why I am still trying to find the spark. 

I think the critics score is a bit high tbh, I would give it a solid 7.

TL;DR: The Outer Worlds 2 is a competent sequel that plays well but plays it too safe. Better than the first, sure, but still missing that special spark that made Obsidian’s older games memorable.

1okiivd,Used Halliday to buy a Valorant skin on payments and instantly regretted it,gaming,1761876264.0,0,0,38,False,"I tried this new thing called Halliday that lets you buy now and pay later for in-game stuff. It sounded harmless at first. I was low on cash but really wanted one of the new Valorant skins, the Oni Phantom bundle, so I figured I’d just split it up. It cost around $80 total, and they offered a plan that was $30 up front and the rest over the next couple of months.

For about a week everything worked fine. Then my next payment date came and I completely forgot about it. The charge failed, and when I logged into Valorant the skin was gone. No warning, no “your payment failed,” just missing from my locker like it never existed.

I emailed Halliday support and they replied a day later saying I would regain access once the account was in good standing. That was it. No time frame, no help, nothing. So now I have paid $30, don’t have the skin, and feel like an idiot for financing pixels.

I get that it was my fault for missing the payment, but it still feels shady that a service can just reach into your account and take away something you already paid part of. I didn’t even know that was possible.

If anyone here is thinking about trying Halliday to grab skins or loot boxes, seriously just wait until you can afford it. The idea of game now pay later sounds fun until you realize it is basically microtransactions on credit.

Steam says that it was used in development but ""*In all such cases, the final product reflects the creativity and expression of our own development team.""* Which means nothing. That's like saying you asked Chat-GPT to make a photo and since you put the prompt in, the finished product reflects your ""expressions and creativity"".

Some [articles](https://tech.yahoo.com/gaming/articles/arc-raiders-devs-don-t-150959107.html) are saying they DON'T use GenAI other than the AI Voices, *""AI text-to-speech is instead what Strandberg calls a ""studio strategy"" to punch above its weight. ""We are trying to maximize what we can, being a small team trying to get make rich worlds right, but still staying small... but we don't use generative AI in other domains across the game,"" he added.""*

So what the hell was used? I mean besides the obvious AI voices, which are atrocious. How can you use Generative AI but then claim it's not in any of the games content, besides the ""voice acting"" which IS generative AI. If concept art, script, hell, even code is AI written, how can you claim that's ethical? And more importantly, why doesn't anyone care anymore?

The story is okay, but it's a somewhat disappointing campaign, I suppose. At the beginning, it does look very promising with interesting characters, the setting, and the plot, until it goes a bit stale during its climax and through to the end.  The overall gameplay loop was very fun, but it becomes more repetitive towards the end, and plus there's the lack of variety in splatterkills. The controls were a little bit stiff at times, especially during the platforming sections. The soundtrack is super great and fits very well during the fighting against enemies or bosses. The overall atmosphere is great and has its unique look to it, but it is definitely missing the eerie vibes from the original trilogy games. The three classic games included are a nice bonus.

Despite my thoughts on the remake, I'd still love to see a new remake of Splatterhouse, although Namco seems to have abandoned the Splatterhouse franchise after the mixed reception of the 2010 remake.

But here's the thing about generations - **each console generation is far shorter than anyone's childhood**. I had a Spectrum, an Amiga, a GBC, an N64 and a PS1 'as a kid' and when I first started uni and played shit loads of couch multiplayer I had at various time a GC, an Xbox and a PS2. When I was a young adult and living in a flatshare we had a Wii in the living room and used to have great party nights playing it. Any and all of the above inspire huge amounts of nostalgia for me.

And yet, if someone says the 6th gen (and the GC in particular seems to encourage this comment the most) was the best, there will almost certainly be people going: Oh, that's just nostalgia. But why would I have more nostalgia for gaming in my late teens/early twenties than in high school or even younger when friends would come round after class to play together. And for someone five years younger than me, why would it be vice versa?

Anyone who played games from a relatively young age will likely have at least three generations of consoles that they played in what will now be looked back on as nostalgia inducing times of their life. So nostalgia doesn't really explain anything other than that what's available now isn't their favourite (and or course, if anyone were to claim a current console was their favourite, well that would just be dismissed as ""recency bias"").

The engineer in question is Ashleigh Amrine, who announced that she had lost her job on LinkedIn yesterday: **""This morning I was part of the layoffs at Amazon Games, alongside my incredibly talented peers on New World and our fledgling Lord of the Rings game (y'all would have loved it),""** she wrote. I've reached out to Amazon for comment.

Colonial fantasy New World has already been confirmed to be ceasing development, following the recent Nighthaven update, as part of a company-wide shift away from MMOs. Amazon will keep the servers warm through 2026, and say they'll give six months notice before making any changes that render the game unplayable.

Amazon's first LOTR MMO was a collaboration with Chinese company Leyou, announced in 2019. It met an unfortunate end in 2021 thanks to an apparent contractual dispute, after Leyou were acquired by Tencent. Amazon revealed the second LOTR MMO in 2023, after partnering with new Middle-earth rights-owner Embracer. They called it a ""persistent open-world MMO adventure"", spanning the events of The Hobbit and the LOTR trilogy, but beyond that, we've never heard much about the project.",False,3672,0.98,67,1314,False

AMA about the tech, design, and Halloween challenge.",gaming,1761758511.0,7,0,3,False,"We’re a small team at **Charm Games**, developers of [HexWind](https://hexwindgame.com/), a PCVR magic roguelite we’ve been building for years with a tiny crew and a lot of stubborn love. Today we’re here for an AMA about the game, the dev journey, and a Halloween experiment we just launched.

**Who we are**

* Small indie VR studio; no publisher, limited budget, very active with our community.
* We’re obsessed with high-ceiling combat systems where mastery really matters.
* Proof we’re us: \[devs will reply from this account + can add lightweight proof in a mod-approved comment if needed\].

**What’s new (Halloween Community Challenge: Oct 24 – Nov 2)**  
We rebuilt one of our bosses—**Mekarion**—for a limited event:

* More health, smarter attack patterns, and new mechanics.
* No shops or grinding, straight to the fight.
* **Twist:** he can’t be beaten in one run. Mekarion has a **global health bar** shared by everyone. Every attempt from any player chips away at the same boss. Think “raid boss energy” in a single-player VR game.

**How it works**

* **When:** Oct 24, 9:00 AM PT through Nov 2, 11:59 PM PT.
* **Attempts:** 3 per day per player; each attempt deals damage to Mekarion’s global HP.
* **Rewards if he dies in time:** all participants get an exclusive wand (**The Dreadmaw**).
* **Top contributors:** the 10 highest total damage dealers get **Mekarion’s flaming skull** as a permanent trophy.

**Why we built it**

  
We wanted HexWind to feel **alive -** events that respond to the community, not just patch notes. As a small team, we can try weird ideas fast. If this lands, we’ll keep going: more community raid bosses, asynchronous PvP events, and regular design/balance chats with players.

**Ask us anything about**

* Designing high-skill magic combat for VR (input mapping, readability, comfort).
* Building a roguelite that’s hard but fair.
* The tech behind a global boss in a single-player game (tracking, anti-cheese, data).
* Content cadence for a tiny team (what we cut, what we shipped, what we learned).
* The business side of indie VR (pricing, wishlists, store pages, and reality checks).
* Post-launch balance and how community feedback changes our roadmap.

We’ll be here **today** answering live for several hours and will check back later for stragglers. We’ll keep links to a minimum; if mods are OK with it, we’ll drop a single comment with optional community hubs for those who want to coordinate runs.

Thanks for reading and for supporting indie VR whether you play HexWind or just want to talk shop, we’re all ears.

Playing on Xbox Series X and its suprisingly good looking and bug-free, especially considering I was playing it for review before the latest patches and early access. Playing on performance mode the most because it actually doesn't feel like much of a difference from quality or balanced (I did a bunch of screenshots to compare and they're honestly so similar). The smaller handcrafterd areas are great. There aren’t a gazillion empty planets to slog through like in Starfield, which honestly just makes me realise more and more that Starfield really should have gone the same way.

My memory is a bit rusty on the first game, but it basically feels like it does all the same things as the first game, just like... better. The gunplay’s fine, nothing special, but it feels good. Stealth is kinda janky, and I was bummed that hacking is just a skill thing with no mini-game. But where Outer Worlds 2 really surprised me is how much theyv'e stuck to the RPG side of things, it's not dummed down into a shooter, it's like a proper RPG, with lots of reading and talking and makes what skills you pick really feel like they matter. Could be good for replayablitlity.

I don't think this is going to be a GOTY contender or anything, but I’ve really been enjoying my time with it. Interested in hearing what fans of the first game think, since I wasn't.

Studios can continue to pay the developers for releasing patches in case of botched releases and they will have an incentive to work towards bettering the product . They already invest millions of dollars to develop and release video games and so many games bomb due to bad reviews. People stop buying the game and the planned patch releases never go out due to funding crunch. 

Now if they release ads in-game they can make money out of it and continue supporting developers.

The final levels of Mario games usually offers a difficult level for instance but I never got frustrated or gave up. They are just the perfect instances of repeat the segments until you achieve. 

But I can't say the same things for NES games for example. Theoretically, they are the same logic, try until you achieve. But the biggest problem with this is the lack of saves. You just need to start over the whole game and the loss of progress just makes you lose motivation of progressing. Not to mention NES games takes around 2-3 hours usually which means a big loss considering this time is the average gametime for a day for most people! And hardest sections in NES games is almost always the last parts. So you need to play 2 hours to be able to practice that part only and obviously you fail and start all over as if you never played. And there are always more than one hard section in the game. 

When the loss of progression is 5-10 minutes when you fail, it doesn't seem to feel like you lose a progress and you practice and repeat until you achieve and you beat it, you feel like you accomplish it.

I hate the games when they limit saves for this reason the most. They try to give you a challenge with it but it only frustrates people since one mistake can cause you days of playing time. Not to mention you might not be able to put the game down when you want it to continue later.

That magazine help the boy beat the game once.  Once.

Going through the magazine, imagine the boy's surprise and horror to find a preview of the NES version of the computer game The Uninvited (collage of pics from that Nintendo Power preview attached).  Scared the living hell out of him.

Same month, the boy is with his grandma at the supermarket and he's flipping through an issue of Gamepro when he comes across an ad for [Zombie Nation](https://www.heypoorplayer.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/nes_zombie_nation_ad-765x1024.jpg) for the NES.

First off, no it doesn't work well.  We tried playing 4 games, 2 at 2 player, 2 at 4 player, and we had a 50% success rate.  Random player drops, duplicate players, disconnection.  It's sad, but really, even when it crashed the absurdity of it all makes it.  

  
How it works - Players are divided into 2 teams a prosecution and a defense.  1 player is the defendant, one player is the plaintiff, and the rest are witnesses.  The court is ruled by AI Snoop.  AI Snoop may be insane.  Snoop calls on people to give testimony or describe a scene and then renders his judgement.  It rarely makes scene but really, I'm not playing to win, I'm playing for insanity.  

The game starts with everyone just telling a story about themselves.  It doesn't have to do with anything.  Tell a dumb story.  After everyone tells a story Snoop picks out a few things and makes a case out of it.  I'm pretty sure the case will be a dumb civil matter, any mention of murder is ignored I think.  

So our cases -

The plaintiff was suing because the organizer of the donkey race he was part of used Disposable plates that weren't eco friendly.  The defense made the case that the plates were made of compressed hay and that the donkeys ate them after but Snoop didn't buy it.  Later the idea of Donkey races being a Mexican tradition came up but snoop ruled that environmentalism was better than tradition.

The second Case crashed before we really got into it

The Third case (our first with 4) was that the defendant ate all the Shrek popsicles that were used to prepare the donkeys before the big donkey race.  Snoop enjoyed and believed the expert testimony that Donkeys run faster after eating Shrek popsicle, but then the game crashed.  

The final case was that the defendant owned a pirate themed cruise ship and didn't pay the defendant their full wages because they shorted the company on an order of lemons.  That was the case Snoop came up with, don't ask me.  Snoop didn't seem to care about invoices, scurvy, the use of oranges in place of lemons or any argument.  The plaintiff won, even though the pirate crew got scurvy.  A travesty of justice.

In some cases you are asked to describe a scene and then some AI art of what you described pops up as evidence.  The quality of the pictures is poor.  The accuracy of the picture is extremely poor.  The pictures look like an absurd fever dream and they always made us laugh at the insanity of it all.

Overall, this isn't a game, it's a really shitty AI that spews nonsense and it's hilarious.  Nothing matter, Snoop is insane, the AI art is absurd, the whole whing is a wild ride that rarely makes sense, often crashes, but yet, I love it and want to play again.  Also it's the rare Jackbox style game that works great with just 2 people.

When I bought my wheel last year, there was only one game I really had in mind: Dirt Rally 2. I also got Project Cars 2 and Assetto Corsa, the latter kind of as an afterthought, thinking it would be quite boring. 

Fast forward a tumultuous year, and I haven't got to spend much time with it yet. I finally got a bit of breathing room and enough motivation to set up the wheel again, and I arrive at one conclusion: I suck at rally. It's enjoyable, yes, but it leaves me exhausted, and I crash more often than anything. 

Project Cars never quite hooked me. In part it was probably due to the game acting weirdly with my wheel. That aside, it never really got me interested for some reason. 

So here I was, low key regretting my purchase, when I decided to fire up Assetto Corsa for the first time, because why not? 

This here was a game that loaded up without much fanfare. It didn't fight with my wheel. It gave me a simple uncluttered menu with an option for quick race directly available. 

I came to yet another conclusion: I suck at driving on tracks too. But boy, this is fun! 

Driving in this game is simply *fun* in a way I can't describe. It feels satisfying to take corners with the wheel. After a couple of graphical mods, it looks brilliant too. There's even a little career mode. The AI is ridiculous, but who needs AI when driving around an empty track is this fun? 

This is a game that lets me drive around in all the cars I could want. I inevitably go off track but it's less annoying than in rally. There's always the desire to improve when I look at hotlaps and find how laughably abysmal my time is compared to the best times. 

And, there are mods. I spent some time modding in the Shutoko Expressway and other free roam maps like Targa Florio. I can now drive around to my heart's content looking at the scenery, simply lost in the pleasure of driving. 

It's been a long time since a game made me feel like this. It brings back childhood memories of when I used to spend countless hours flying around in modded airplanes in Microsoft Flight Simulator X. My adult self hasn't experienced anything close to this. 

For all I know this will fizzle out. I'll grow tired of driving and move on to other games. But this discovery is something I'll cherish, and from time to time, I'll pop back in for a relaxed drive around the Nürburgring in a simple car. ",True,46,0.78,30,2459,False

1ohf5kz,The differences in the amount of time people have to game really causes issues for Devs,gaming,1761573552.0,1154,0,283,False,"First of all, this isn’t meant as a criticism of anyone who has the time to dedicate long hours to gaming. I completely understand that people enjoy different playstyles and have varying amounts of free time. However, I’ve noticed a growing trend on Reddit that I find quite interesting — and a little concerning — when it comes to how quickly players consume games today.

Across various gaming subreddits, I often see posts almost immediately after a game’s release asking about downloadable content, expansions, or New Game+ modes. It feels as though many players rush through the base game so fast that they’re already looking ahead for something more before others have even finished the main story.

This year, for example, I’ve been playing *Kingdom Come: Deliverance II*, *Ghosts of Yotei*, *Ball X Pit*, and the usual *FIFA* sessions with friends. In each of those communities, I’ve seen countless threads along the lines of “Where’s the DLC?”, “When is New Game+ coming?”, or “I’ve already max-leveled my character.” Meanwhile, I’m still working my way through the main storyline, far from 100% completion.

I usually play for about one to two hours most evenings, which I think puts me in the range of an average player. Yet it sometimes feels like the gaming world moves at a completely different pace — one where people finish massive, content-rich games within days and are immediately eager for more.

It’s not a complaint, exactly — just an observation about how gaming habits have evolved. With the abundance of content and constant updates in modern games, it seems many players are less inclined to savor the experience and more focused on what’s next.

Even there is a lot of side missions it didn't fell repetitive at all, all side mission has like an unique bonus story.

1og1sy4,Soul Calibur III - A remembrance and a lament,gaming,1761424171.0,36,0,35,False,"Today marks the 20th anniversary of the release of Soul Calibur III.  I still remember going to the video store to rent it.  It was raining that day and a bit foggy, perfect day to be inside a playing a video game.  My mother asked me what game I rented and I told her saying that it was ""kind of like The Three Musketeers"", which my mom would have known from the movie with Gene Kelly and Lana Turner.  Except The Three Musketeers didn't have a samurai, a lady wearing next to nothing wielding a chain whip sword, lizardmen, a couple of eldritch abominations, and is actually set 30 years prior to the events of Alexander Dumas' story.

I liked that challenge the game gave you in having to go through multiple playthroughs to unlock all the characters.  I even had a strategy guide that had all the characters moves and I mean all of them.  Big, huge thing it was.  Only thing it lacked was a guide for each character's path to fighting Night Terror.  And when I did encounter that thing, it would more often than not wipe the floor with me like I was a janitor's push broom.  But you would get a good amount of in game money to spend if you beat him.

And then there's the voice cast - Crispin Freeman, Eden Riegel, Kari Wahlgren, Keith Silverstein.  A very solid voice acting cast.  

That brings me to the next and best feature the game had - create a Soul.  The first of the series to have it.  You could buy armor and clothing and things to make your own fighter.  Yeah, you actually had to purchase your equipment to make your character and what you equipped you character with effected how well their offence and defense was in battle.  This wasn't just a cosmetic thing.

Tied to create a Soul was Soul Calibur III's second best feature - an original story not connected to our world.  You created your character from a set of classes and the higher your original character got in level, another character class would be unlocked, and the higher level two classes other classes got you would unlock the highest class levels.  Also, these levels came with their own class of weapons that the main Soul Calibur cast couldn't use like grieves and battle fans and tambourines.

And that's where the lament comes in.  Soul Calibur III was as far as they could have gone with the main cast.  The story mode being set in a fictional fantasy world is where they should have gone for the sequels.  They could have done so much more with that.  They could have still had the main fighters but they would come from made up countries on a made up world.  But, no, we still had to be set on Earth with cheap as characters like Hilde easily able to do ""ring outs"".

So, sales and quality for the series declined.  And with Team Soul disbanded, it looks like the six Soul Calibur will be the last, the characters sent off to the Namco Vault, which in my mind is a combo of The Disney Vault, a Vault from Fallout with the evil experiments, and the Island of Misfit Toys from Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.  A depressing thought, but a sad reality.  I did say there was a lament.  Now the only Souls games Bandai Namco releases are ones where you really need to be good at dodging and timing or you'll die easily.

Tl:dr Soul Calibur III was great and the series is very much missed.  A lot of potential unrealized causing it to get to get stuck in a rut along with guest characters that weren't needed nor were a big draw brought the series to its end...for now.",True,36,0.8,45,3457,True

In the past 12 months, I rolled the credits / finished the following:

* Black Myth: Wukong (platinum trophy)
* Dragon Age: The Veilguard
* Lords of the Fallen (played when it first came out, but got the other endings finally this year)
* Assassin’s Creed Shadows
* Avowed
* First Berserker: Khazan
* Clair Obscur:  Expedition 33 (my personal choice for game of the year)
* Metaphor: ReFantazio
* Death Stranding:  On The Beach
* WUCHANG: Fallen Feathers (platinum trophy)
* Played 2 different seasons of Diablo IV
* Path of Exile 2 beta - took 1 character through the story

It seems so weird to me, I am that strong vampire who can one punch a thief, or a robber, which is also annoying cause I cannot normally punch so I could just stun him or smth, not smash like a hulk. 
But when I am attacked by same kind of enemies, not vampires , they suddenly become stronger so when they block damaged reduced significantly, while they block with bare hands. To evade enemies attack I can only dash/dodge . 

Am I missing something? I just don’t get it, blocking would make this game too easy? Make enemies stronger, smarter . 

I can use telekinesis (q key) , but it’s so poorly executed , after first pull, enemies can resist vampires abilities somehow.
