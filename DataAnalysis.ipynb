    "# Step 1: Business Understanding\n",
    "Reddit is a highly popular social media platform that is used by a wide range of individuals, entrepeneurs, and businesses. It's popularity offers the potential of a global reach to posters across an extremely diverse range of topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Audience:\n",

    "- Entrepeneurs advertising products to niche markets.\n",
    "- Musicians/performers trying to build a platform.\n",
    "- \"Influencers\" trying to gain recognition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining Success:\n",
    "The success/popularity of a Reddit post can be measured with \"Karma\" which corresponds to the total sum of ratings on a post, i.e. upvotes minus downvotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aims of the project.\n",
    "Determining how a Reddit post's popularity is influenced can allow these groups to achieve the maximum reach possible. By analysing the information associated with Reddit posts and comparing it to their popularity, I hope to answer:\n",
    "1. How is post length connected to post success?\n",
    "2. Is date/time of posting relevant to a post's success.\n",
    "3. How does the \"mood\" found in a post's body influence its success?\n",
    "4. Are there any other factors that affect how a Reddit post will be received?\n"
